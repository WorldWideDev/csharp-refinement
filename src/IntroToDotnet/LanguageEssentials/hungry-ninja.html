<h1>Hungry Ninja</h1>
<p>Taking what we've learned from the <strong>Human</strong> assignment, let's explore how different classes can interact with one another using private properties, public getters, and class methods.</p>
<p>For the everyday ninja on a lunch break there is Ninja Buffet! It's All-You-Can-Eat, serving bold flavors and delicious calories to the hardworking ninjas of this world. Please note, we will be revisiting your work here in a later assignment.</p>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<h3>Create a <code>Food</code> class</h3>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Food
{
    public string Name;
    public int Calories;
    // Foods can be Spicy and/or Sweet
    public bool IsSpicy; 
    public bool IsSweet; 

    // add a constructor that takes in all four parameters: Name, Calories, IsSpicy, IsSweet
}
</pre>
<hr>
<h3>Create a <code>Buffet</code> class, which will contain a <em>Menu</em> of <code>Food</code> objects</h3>
<ul>
    <li>add a constructor and set Menu to a hard coded list of 7 or more Food objects you instantiate manually</li>
    <li>build out a Serve method that randomly selects a Food object from the Menu list and returns the Food object</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Buffet
{
    public List&lt;Food&gt; Menu;
    &nbsp;
    //constructor
    public Buffet()
    {
        Menu = new List&lt;Food&gt;()
        {
            new Food("Example", 1000, false, false)
        };
    }
    &nbsp;
    public Food Serve()
    {
    }
}
</pre>

<h3>Create a <code>Ninja</code> class</h3>
<ul>
    <li>add a constructor that sets calorieIntake to 0 and creates a new, empty list of Food objects to FoodHistory</li>
    <li>add a public "getter" property called "IsFull" that returns a boolean based on if the Ninja's calorie intake is greater than 1200 calories</li>
    <li>build out the Eat method that: 
        <em>if the Ninja is NOT full</em>
        <ul>
            <li>adds calorie value to ninja's total calorieIntake</li>
            <li>adds the randomly selected Food object to ninja's FoodHistory list</li>
            <li>writes the Food's Name - and if it is spicy/sweet to the console</li>
        </ul>
        <em>if the Ninja IS full</em>
        <ul>
            <li>issues a warning to the console that the ninja is full and cannot eat anymore</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Ninja
{
    private int calorieIntake;
    public List&lt;Food&gt; FoodHistory;
    &nbsp;
    // add a constructor
    &nbsp;
    // add a public "getter" property called "IsFull"
    &nbsp;
    // build out the Eat method
    public void Eat(Food item)
    {
    }
}
</pre>
