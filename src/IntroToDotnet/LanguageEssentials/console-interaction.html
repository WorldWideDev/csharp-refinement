<h2>Writing to the Console</h2>
<p>When we initially set up a base .NET app in our <em>Intro to .NET</em> section using the <code>dotnet new</code> command, we ended up with some code in our Program.cs that looked&nbsp;something like this...</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">using System;
namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>First, the Main method inside the Program class is the method that is called when we run the command <code>dotnet run</code> (whether in a console app or any other type of C# application).</p>
<p>Inside our Main method, we see the function of&nbsp;<strong>Console.WriteLine().</strong>&nbsp;This is a function provided to us from the System library (note the <code>using System;</code> statement at the top of the file) that will be our main means of console string output. This function accepts a value and will&nbsp;display the value passed to it&nbsp;to the terminal window as a single line.</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">Console.WriteLine("Using Console.WriteLine, you can output any string to the terminal/console");
</pre>
<!-- simplify this section to show different ways to do string concatenation -->
<p>Even more so, for variables that are not inherently strings, so long as the type has a valid ToString method (such as an integer), Console.WriteLine will&nbsp;display it as a string with no explicit type conversion needed!</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">int favoriteNum = 42;
Console.WriteLine("You can even directly print numbers such as the one below...");
Console.WriteLine(favoriteNum);
</pre>
<p>The mixing strings and other variables&nbsp;can also be accomplished by placing tokens inside your output string and supplying the WriteLine function with additional parameters or by making use of string concatenation.</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">//Making use of tokens makes injection of variables into strings quite simple
Console.WriteLine("The {0} cow, jumped over the {1}, {2} times!", "brown", "Moon", 7);
//Results in "The brown cow, jumped over the Moon, 7 times!"
//We can also make use of string concatenation, though, if preferred
string name = "David";
Console.WriteLine(10 + " Chickens attacked " + name);
//Results in "10 Chickens attacked David"
</pre>
<p>You can even perform operations directly on a string by making use of string interpolation.</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">string interpol = $"The answer to 2 + 7 is {2+7}";
Console.WriteLine(interpol);
//Outputs "The answer to 2 + 7 is 9"
</pre>
