<h1>Language Integrated Queries</h1>
<p>LINQ (pronounced "link") allows you to work with any dataset as if you were using SQL queries. It's a very valuable tool that exists in the .NET framework and makes sorting, ordering, and searching of datasets very simple once you learn the syntax. There are two different notations we can use with LINQ, and we will demonstrate both throughout the chapter. Anything you can write in one syntax can be written in the other, but those more comfortable with SQL may prefer the query syntax. (Query syntax is actually translated into method syntax during compilation.) Be sure to include the LINQ namespace (<code>System.Linq</code>) whenever you are using LINQ.</p>
<h3>Method Syntax</h3>
<p>When using method syntax, we have to learn about lambda expressions. A lambda expression is a way of writing an otherwise cumbersome function in a simplified inline expression. When we use a LINQ method and pass in a lambda function, we are specifying the condition or parameter on which we want the query to execute. The operator is the <code>=></code> symbol, read as "goes to." On the left of the arrow is an argument (a variable name of your choosing), which represents the iterated item. On the right of the arrow is typically the condition or parameter to be used for the given query. If the body of the function is more than one line, it should be wrapped in curly braces.</p>
<h3>Query Syntax</h3>
<p>Query syntax, on the other hand, looks much more like SQL, though in a slightly different order. In query syntax, we start with <code>from</code> and specify the dataset we will be iterating through. We can add additional clauses as our query requires (filtering conditions, joins, groupings, etc.). Finally, we use the <code>select</code> clause to specify what data we actually want to be returned.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a few examples to get familiar with LINQ. Suppose we have previously defined the Product class and have the following dataset:</p>
<pre data-language="c-sharp" class="active_pre rainbow">Product[] products = {
     new Product { Name = "Jeans", Category = "Clothing", Price = 24.7 },
     new Product { Name = "Socks", Category = "Clothing", Price = 8.12 },
     new Product { Name = "Scooter", Category = "Vehicle", Price = 99.99 },
     new Product { Name = "Skateboard", Category = "Vehicle", Price = 24.99 },
     new Product { Name = "Skirt", Category = "Clothing", Price = 17.5 }
};
</pre>
<h5>Sorting</h5>
<p>Let's sort all the products by price.</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">
    // METHOD SYNTAX
    IEnumerable<Product> orderedProducts = products.OrderByDescending(p => p.Price);

    // QUERY SYNTAX
    IEnumerable<Product> orderedProducts = from p in products
                                           orderby p.Price descending
                                           select p;
</pre>

<!-- color coded diagram with foreach loop to demonstrate how each of these pieces could be written out in a full for loop -->
<p>What is this IEnumerable type? This is simply the interface for any data type that can be iterated over. LINQ can be used on sets of data, but that data may originate in many different forms (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.). To provide the same functionality for any type of dataset, LINQ works on any class that implements the IEnumerable interface. (Are you seeing the power of interfaces yet? :) ). Note also that none of these queries affect the original collection.</p>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
<p>One of the most common clauses you will use is the <code>where</code> clause or method. This allows us to filter on a specific condition(s).</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">
    // METHOD SYNTAX
    IEnumerable<Product> allClothing = products.Where(prod => prod.Category == "Clothing");

    // QUERY SYNTAX
    IEnumerable<Product> allClothing = from p in products
                                      where p.Category == "Clothing"
                                      select p;
</pre>
<h5>Select</h5>
<p>Most method syntax operations return an IEnumerable of the same type as the original source. If we wanted to select only some of the properties of that class, we can use <code>select</code>. The select clause or method transforms each item in a collection and returns a collection of the newly defined results in the form of an anonymous object. For anonymous objects, we can use type inference with the <strong>var</strong> keyword.</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">
    // METHOD SYNTAX
    var clothingNamesAndPrices = products.Where(p => p.Category == "Clothing").Select(p => new {p.Name, p.Price});

    // QUERY SYNTAX
    var clothingNamesAndPrices = from p in products
                                 where p.Category == "Clothing"
                                 select new {p.Name, p.Price};
</pre>
<h5>Join</h5>
<p>If we have two collections and we want to combine their values we can use the <code>Join</code> method or <code>join</code> clause. A join operates on each value in both collections and combines them based on some equivalance. The <code>Join</code> method is very similar to the SQL "join" operation; it will return an entry for each match it finds in the two collections.</p>
<p>
<code>Join</code> accepts four arguments, in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>The second collection we want to join with</li>
<li>A lambda function that defines the value from the first collection to use for comparison</li>
<li>A lambda function that defines the value from the second collection to use for comparison</li>
<li>A lambda function that defines how the matching values should be returned</li>
</ol>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">List&lt;string&gt; Food = new List&lt;string&gt; {
                              "apple",
                              "banana",
                              from-rainbow"&gt;"carrot",
                              "fudge",
                              "tomato"
                          };
                           
List&lt;string&gt; Adjective = new List&lt;string&gt; {
                              "tasty",
                              "capital",
                              "best",
                              "typical",
                              "flavorful",
                              "toothsome"
                          };
 
// each string in the Food list will be combined with each adjective from the Adjective list where their first characters match

//METHOD SYNTAX
IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Combo = Food.Join(Adjective, 
                                foodItem =&gt; foodItem[0],
                                adjective =&gt; adjective[0],
                                (foodItem, adjective) =&gt;
                                {
                                    return adjective + " " + foodItem;
                                });
 
//QUERY SYNTAX
IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; Combo = from foodItem in Food
                           join adjective in Adjective on foodItem[0] equals adjective[0]
                           select adjective + " " + foodItem;

//Combo == "best banana",
//         "capital carrot",
//         "flavorful fudge",
//         "tasty tomato",
//         "typical tomato",
//         "toothsome tomato"
 
// Notice that apple is not in the combination collection because it does not match an adjective

<p>LINQ methods can be chained together as long as the previous one returns a new collection to be operated on.</p>
