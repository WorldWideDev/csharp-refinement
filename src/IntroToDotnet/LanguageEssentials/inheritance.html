<h1>Inheritance</h1>
<p>Consider the Vehicle class from the previous sections. This class possesses a general blueprint that can describe any vehicle, but what if we want to describe different <strong>types </strong>of vehicles. <br></p>
<p>By taking the generic code already in place and adding different details, we can create things like a Bike, Car, or Boat from our Vehicle class into their own separate classes without repeating necessary code using <strong>inheritance</strong>. When one class inherits from another, it gains all the members of the parent class. Any members that a class inherits will also be passed to its child classes. This sequence of passing information down through multiple levels of classes is called the <strong>inheritance chain</strong>.</p>

<p>For our code to work, we will need to make sure to take in to account the <strong>constructor </strong>requirements of the parent class.</p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Vehicle
{
    public int NumPassengers;
    public string Color;
    public double Odometer;

    // Say Vechile has two overloaded constructors
    // We will either need to pass up two values (int, string), from Car ...
    public Vehicle(int numPas, string col)
    {   
        NumPassengers = numPas;
        Color = col;
        Odometer = 0;
    }
    // Or just one string value.  
    public Vehicle(string col)
    {
        NumPassengers = 5;
        Color = col;
        Odometer = 0;
    }
    
}
// Defining a child class of Vehicle
class Car : Vehicle
{
    // We can add members that are unique to Cars, things that won't describe ALL vehicles
    public string Make;
    public string Model;

    // but when we define a constructor for Car, we need to satisfy any constructor requirements
    // for at least ONE constructor on the parent Vehicle class
    public Car(string color, string make, string model) : base(color)
    {
        Make = make;
        Model = model;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <strong>base</strong> keyword following&nbsp;the new class constructor is done to pass the needed variables to the parent class' constructor method. The parent class's constructor will be run, and then the child class's&nbsp;constructor will execute. Because of this, we can keep all the properties and functionality of the parent class while still having the ability to add to or overwrite them.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Method Overriding</h2>
<p>
It's great that we can inherit functionality from our parent class as well as add new functionality, but what if we want to change the functionality of one of these parent methods? The process for this is actually quite simple! We can mark the parent method with the <code>virtual</code> keyword, which means that it can be overridden by a child class. Then we just add a method to our child class - with the same name and parameters as its parent - and with the <code>override</code> keyword.</p>

    public virtual void GetInfo()

        Console.WriteLine($"Color: {Color}");

<p>
Wait, but this again just solves one problem and creates another! What if we want to just add functionality to a method, not completely over-write everything it does! Well, we are in luck. With a simple additional line to what we have done above, we can change the process of method overriding to not just replace all existing functionality, but extend this functionality.</p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Vehicle
{
    //All past code for the Vehicle should still be present
    public virtual void GetInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Num Passengers: {NumPassengers}");

        Console.WriteLine($"Miles: {Odometer}");

    //All past code for the Car Class should still be present
    public override void GetInfo()
    {
        //This line will call the parent's version of this method first 
        base.GetInfo();
        //Then add any additional code to it!
        Console.WriteLine($"Make: {Make}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Model: {Model}");
    }
}

class Program

    public static void Main(string[] args)

        Vehicle someVehicle = new Vehicle("Green");
        Car someCar = new Car("Yellow", "Dodge", "Dart");

        someCar.GetInfo();
    }

<h2>Inheritance and Accessibility</h2>
<p>Say we wanted to restrict access to <code>Odometer</code> in the Vehicle class.  If we made Odometer <code>private</code>, it would only be accessible to the Vehicle class <em>and not accessible</em> to Car.  This would make it impossible to implement a <code>Drive</code> method on Car!</p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Vehicle
{
    //All past code for the Vehicle should still be present
    private double Odometer;
}
&nbsp;
class Car : Vehicle
{
    //All past code for the Car Class should still be present
    public void Drive(double distance)
    {
        // 'Vehicle.Odometer' is inaccessible due to its protection level!!!
        Odometer += distance;
        Console.WriteLine("I'm driving!");
    }
}
</pre>
<p>To restrict access to all classes <em>outside</em> the inheritance chain, you can use <code>protected</code>.  That way, Odometer can remain safely inaccessible to any classes other than those that are a descendant of <code>Vehicle</code>, and thus be available to the <code>Car</code> class.</p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Vehicle
{
    // Now Car access Odometer!
    protected double Odometer;
}
&nbsp;
class Car : Vehicle
{
    
    public void Drive(double distance)
    {
        Odometer += distance;
        Console.WriteLine("I'm driving!");
    }
}
</pre>
<hr>
<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
<p>When our classes start inheriting from other classes, we also have to consider polymorphism. Polymorphism is the idea that objects can be treated as if they belonged to any of the classes above them in the inheritance chain. We can instantiate objects of a child class and store it in a variable of its parent type, group them together in arrays/lists as the parent type, or use the parent type as a member of an additional class.</p>
