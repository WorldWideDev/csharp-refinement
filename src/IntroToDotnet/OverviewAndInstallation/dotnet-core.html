<h1>.NET Core</h1>
<p>In November 2014, Microsoft announced its intention to open source more than just the language compiler components. Microsoft announced that they were going to produce a new open-source, cross-platform version of .NET called <strong><em>.NET Core</em></strong>, and with it, they would include open-source, cross-platform versions of ASP.NET and Entity Framework (<strong><em>ASP.NET Core</em></strong>, <strong><em>Entity Framework Core</em></strong>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wait from announcement to actual release is always a long one, and this one was no different. A year after the announcement, by November 2015, the Release Candidate (RC1) of .NET Core was released. During the next six months, the API changed in a few disruptive ways leading to the release of RC2 in May 2016. The official release of <b>.NET Core 1.0</b> was in <b>June 2016</b>.</p>
<p>
 <em>What were Microsoft's motivations for releasing a cross-platform, open-source version of .NET?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>By releasing .NET Core (and the accompanying web and ORM pieces), Microsoft would start to "get back in the game" with small software companies that could not afford to be "Microsoft shops" with Microsoft Windows, SQL Server, etc. However, they knew that some would not be comfortable until these pieces were not only cross-platform, but entirely open-source.</p>
<p>After all, the original ASP.NET MVC was explicitly modeled after Ruby on Rails, which at that point was a rapidly rising new open-source stack. By going fully open, Microsoft indicated that it was ready to compete with Ruby on Rails, Java, Python/Django, nodeJS, and all the other open-source stacks.</p>
<h3>More on .NET Core</h3>
<p><em>Is .NET Core the same as the previous version of .NET?</em></p>
<p>.NET Core is <i>not</i> simply the next version of the .NET Framework. It is actually a reimplementation of the official CLI standard, plus some new things -- but much less than the full v4.6 .NET Framework. For this reason, it is simultaneously a superset and a subset of the previously-released .NET Framework.</p>
<p>This new .NET Core is not just cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux) and open source (in GitHub, with Apache2 and MIT licenses) in <em>name only</em> -- it really tries to fit the spirit of openness. For example, .NET Core is fully compatible with Mono, Xamarin, and the .NET Framework. This has provided an app which targeted the .NET Standard Library, which is only slightly larger than the BCL. Also, .NET Core can be installed either app-only, or for all apps but user-only, or machine-wide. And finally, every scenario can be executed from the command-line interface -- no VS required.</p>
<p>The intention with .NET Core is to enable third-party pieces at every step of the way, and that is often what we will do. One could&nbsp;develop on non-Windows without VS,&nbsp;use a different web framework and a different database, go without the Microsoft ORM, deploy to servers that are not Windows, and the .NET Core system should still hold together, based on the CLI interface and a solid C# implementation.</p>
<h3>Connecting .NET Core to the Web</h3>
<p><em>OK, what is ASP.NET Core, then?</em></p>
<p><strong><em>ASP.NET Core</em></strong> is the follow-up to ASP.NET MVC v5, where both frameworks are specifically for building web applications. Like .NET Core, it is also open-source (found on GitHub) and cross-platform. It ships entirely via NuGet packages and installs side-by-side just as .NET Core does.&nbsp;Apps written with ASP.NET Core can run on .NET Core <em>and</em>&nbsp;.NET Framework. They can host in IIS, or self-host in-process using a new web server called <b><em>Kestrel</em></b>. ASP.NET Core is designed to work well with a number of client-side frameworks, such as Angular, Bootstrap, or Knockout.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Accessing Your Data</h3>
<p>
 <em>And then what is Entity Framework Core?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
 <b>Entity Framework Core</b> (<b>EF Core</b>)&nbsp;is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET, similar to EF v6.x and earlier. Like ASP.NET Core, an application that uses EF Core can target a few different platforms:</p>
<ul>
 
<li>ASP.NET Core,&nbsp;</li> 
<li>.NET Core (without ASP.NET Core),&nbsp;</li> 
<li>Universal Windows Platform (apps that run on Windows 10 and Win10 Mobile)</li> 
<li>Full Windows-based .NET Framework</li></ul>

<p>The collection of .NET Core, C#, ASP.NET Core, EF Core and VS Code are a potent combination that should have us productive very soon!</p>
