<h1>Open Src, X-platform</h1>
<p>Microsoft has a history of being an open platform that welcomes third-party contributions on top of those platforms. As mentioned earlier, the CLR supports any programming language that can compile itself into CIL format. Starting at the very beginning with v1.0, the CLR has published a specification of the&nbsp;<i>Common Language Infrastructure</i>&nbsp;(<b><em>CLI</em></b>), spelling out what language providers must do in order to work as .NET-supported languages. This has made it possible for more than 20 languages to have some sort of .NET implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is less common until recently was Microsoft's willingness to allow substitutions of its own platform pieces. For example, the CLI also made it possible for a company Xamarin to create an implementation of the .NET Framework for Unix and Linux platforms&nbsp;called <em><strong>Mono</strong></em>. This is what enables the game authoring engine Unity to build code (C#) that runs on Mac, Linux or Windows. Also, Microsoft has announced that nearly 1/3 of all Azure virtual machines are running Linux. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once an unspeakable subject, it is now reasonable to consider Microsoft core products running on other operating systems. OneNote, considered by some to be the "secret weapon in Office", not only runs on MacOS, iOS, and Android, it is even free! Yes, there is a premium version that bears a price, but this was a notable indicator that many at Microsoft had changed their mindsets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In mid-2015, Microsoft announced that it was developing a free, cross-platform source code editor called <em><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></em> (<b>VS Code</b>). With a plug-in from OmniSharp, it supported debugging, Git, syntax highlighting, and code completion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond just cross-platform, beyond just free, within the past few years, Microsoft had been releasing more and more programming language properties, as open source, such as the <em>F#</em> compiler, the "<em>Chakra</em>" JavaScript engine, the next-generation "<em>Roslyn</em>" compilers for C# and VB, and even the <em>PowerShell</em> scripting environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the end of 2015, Microsoft had released VS Code as open source as well. What next?!</p>
