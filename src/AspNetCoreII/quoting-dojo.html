<h2>Quoting Dojo</h2>
<p>You are going to build a simple app that allows users to add quotes to a database and display them on a separate page.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>'add my quote'</strong>&nbsp;button should add the user's quote to the database, but the 'skip to quotes' button should take the user directly to the main page.</p>
<p>Use the following URLs for your project:</p>
<ul><li><strong>GET ' / '</strong>&nbsp;for the screen on the left.</li><li><strong>POST '/quotes'</strong>&nbsp;for the method of the form to make a new quote.</li><li><strong>GET '/quotes'</strong>&nbsp;for the screen on the right (where all the quotes are rendered.</li></ul>
<p>When you create a new quote if there are errors with the model, you should&nbsp;<strong>render a view and pass errors to that view instead of redirecting.</strong>&nbsp;That way we won't lose our data and thereby not need to use a session variable!</p>
