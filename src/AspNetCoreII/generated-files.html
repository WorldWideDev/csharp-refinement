<h1>Generated Files</h1>
<p>
There are nifty features that both <code>dotnet new mvc</code> and <code>dotnet new dojo</code> make use of that you will want to know more about.  Notably, these templates make use of a "Layout" file that you can use to serve as a master HTML document and can house the various Views you are serving from your Controllers.  This means you only need to define a complete HTML document one time, and keep your other View files lean.
</p>
<h4>Layout File</h4>
<p>
Most web apps have a common layout that provides the user with a consistent experience as they navigate from page to page. The layout typically includes common user interface elements such as the app header, navigation or menu elements, and footer.&nbsp;Common HTML structures such as scripts and stylesheets are also frequently used by many pages within an app. All of these shared elements may be defined in a layout file, which can then be referenced by any view used within the app. Layouts reduce duplicate code in views, helping them follow the Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.&nbsp;By convention, the default layout for an ASP.NET app is named _Layout.cshtml; and our mvc template includes a fairly robust layout file in the Views/Shared folder for you. In this default template, both Bootstrap and jQuery are loaded, as well as a common css (site.css) and javascript (site.js) file for you to use.  Feel free to remove any elements you don't wish to use.  In addition to the default elements, you may place any HTML you want shared throughout your project's views. You can even have multiple layouts which can be cycled through or used on different sections of your app. Another file related to the Layout that our mvc template generates
<strong>_ViewStart.cshtml</strong>
is where the current active Layout for views is set.
</p>
<p>
The
<code>_Layout.cshtml</code>
file that our mvc template generates for us looks something like this:
</p>
<pre data-language="html" class="active_pre rainbow">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;MyCoolProj&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!-- css / js imports removed for brevity --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="container body-content"&gt;
        @RenderBody()
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Take special notice of the
<code>@RenderBody()</code>
line. Whenever our app returns a View, it first renders this layout file,
<strong>then</strong>
our view file is rendered in place of
<code>@RenderBody()</code>
. Because of this our views never need their own &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, or &lt;body&gt; tags and also don't need their own link to our
<code>site.css</code>
. We can also modify
<code>_Layout.cshtml</code>
to include any elements that we want to appear on every page of our app, like a Header or a link to the Home page.
</p>
<h4>ViewStart</h4>
<p>
In the Views folder of our generated project there is a file called
<code>_ViewStart.cshtml</code>
. This ViewStart file is run before any view is rendered. When our mvc template generates this file all it does is ensure that the default Layout is used by all views.  You may have as many layout files as you wish, for example maybe you want views in your DashboardController to share a navbar.  You can add a ViewStart file to Views/Dashboard, and set <code>Layout</code> to a Layout file that has a navbar.  ASP's view-finding system will prioritize views in a controller's view directory over Shared/, so you won't have to worry about conflicting with the master Layout in Views/Shared.
</p>
<h4>ViewImports</h4>
<p>
Alongside the ViewStart file you should also find a file called
<code>_ViewImports.cshtml</code>
. ViewImports is used to import any additional packages or namespaces that are needed by multiple views. The default
<code>_ViewImports.cshtml</code>
created by our mvc template brings in our project namespace with a using statement and activates some additional Razor functionality.  You can bring in additional namespace references to this file as well, making the classes they contain available to your views without an explicit path.  To do this, simply add another line:
</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">    // _ViewImports.cshtml
    @using MyCoolProj.AnotherNamespace
</pre>
<h4>Tip!</h4>
<p>Both _ViewStart and _ViewImports can be generated with the <code>dotnet new</code> command, with <code>dotnet new viewimports</code> and <code>dotnet new viewstart</code>.  This is useful if you wish to start new projects with the more lightweight <code>dotnet new dojo / dotnet new mvc</code> template.  These will be placed wherever you run the command from in your terminal - which more than likely, will be in your project's working directory.  Since these files will want to go in your Views/ directory, you can use the <code>-o</code> flag to specify a location.  So you can run:</p>
<pre data-language="bash" class="rainbow">    dotnet new viewimports -o Views
    // and
    dotnet new viewstart -o Views
</pre>
<p>To place them in the appropriate directory.</p>
