<h1>Deploying with a Database</h1>
<p>For our first deployment with a database, we're going to use Azure's new built-in MySQL tool. Follow the regular deployment instructions and then navigate to the "MySQL In APP (preview)" tab as shown. Turn on the in-app Db and save it. Navigate to your deployed page once and the database tools will be activated, then click "Manage" at the top of the MySQL In App tab. <strong>If you do not visit your page at least once you will be unable to access the database tools!</strong></p>

<p>If you see the following screen when you attempt to manage your DB:</p>

<p><strong>Then</strong> <strong>you have not visited your page yet!</strong> Navigate to your deployed site, even if it has no content yet.</p>
<p>You can manually create a database within the database admin page, or upload a copy of a local database. To copy one or your existing databases you'll have to first export it into a <code>.sql</code> file. To do so, open up one of your MySQL workbench connections and select "Data Export" under the "Server" tab. Choose the schema/s you want to copy&nbsp;and make sure to check the "Include Create Schema" option. Once the <code>.sql</code> file has been created, return to the Azure database manager.</p>

 <li>Choose the <code>.sql</code> file you created.</li> <li>Upload the schema and copy it to your in-app database.</li> <li>Use the given IP and Port to configure the database connection string in your code.</li></ol>

<p>Whether you create a new schema or upload one, you will have to configure your connection string to match your in-app database.</p>

<p>With your connection string set up, simply commit the new changes to your git repo and push it to Azure!</p>
