<h1>The Dojo League</h1>
<p>For this assignment, we will be building another CRUD application that will put to test our skills with Dapper relationships. We are going to build a site that tracks various Ninjas and the Dojos they are currently training under. For this, the following things are required.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Create a "Ninjas" page</h4>
<ul>
<li>Have a List of all ninjas and the dojos they are a part of. If they are not yet part of a dojo it should list them as "Rogue"</li><li>On this same page, there should be a section to register new ninjas</li>
<li>Newly registered ninjas require a name, a level between 1 &amp; 10, an assigned Dojo (or Rogue), and optionally a description</li>
<li>Ninja and Dojo names should be links to their respective show pages</li>
</ul>
<h4>Create a "Dojos" page</h4>
<ul>
<li>Have a List of all dojos all of which are clickable links to individual show pages</li>
<li>Have a form for creating a new Dojo. This form should include fields for Name, Location, and Additional Information all with their&nbsp;respective validations</li>
</ul>
<h4>Create a show page for a single Ninja</h4>
<ul>
<li>The page should include the ninja's name, level, and description</li>
<li>It should also contain a note of their current dojo as a link or list them as "Rogue"</li>
</ul>
<h4>Create a show page for a single Dojo</h4>
<ul>
<li>This page should include all information about the Dojo including Name, Location, and Information</li>
<li>It should include a list of all ninjas currently part of the dojo including a button to "Banish" them; removing their association with that dojo.</li>
<li>All Ninjas currently not part of a dojo (AKA Rogue) should also be listed with the ability to "Recruit" them, thereby adding them to the current dojo roster</li>
</ul>
