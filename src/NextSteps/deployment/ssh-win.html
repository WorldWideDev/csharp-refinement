<h1>Connecting (For PC)</h1>
<p>Let's access this computer. We can access our files on our local machine in two main ways. We can either use a GUI like Windows Explorer to see our files or we can use the command prompt to access the file structure of our computer. To access our EC2 instance, we are going to use a program called PuTTy. This is really cool. It's as if we are right next to the EC2 instance that we bought, and we are running the PuTTy application on that computer. This also means that we won't have access to a GUI like Windows Explorer to access the file structure, so it is crucial that we know general terminal commands to navigate the files.</p>
<p>
<strong>Generate a .ppk file</strong></p>
<ol><li>Using your PC, Download&nbsp;<strong>WinSCP</strong>. You can download it&nbsp;<a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php" target="_blank">here</a>. Using WinSCP, we can then generate a <em>.ppk</em> file ( This is an extra step for a Windows OS because we can't use Command Prompt to access our Ubuntu computer. We use PuTTy to communicate to our server and in order for us to do that, we need to convert <strong>.pem</strong> file to <strong>.ppk</strong> file.</li><li>Open WinSCP and click on&nbsp;<strong>Tools &gt; Run PuttyGen<br>
</strong><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hpXeZ4b.png" style="background-color: initial;"></li><li>Click on <strong>Load</strong> and locate your <em>.pem "myfirstinstance"</em> key.<p><br></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JKlhbza.png"></p></li><li>Key in your passphrase under "Key passphrase and Confirm Passphrase" and hit <strong>Save private key.</strong> Make sure you take note of your passphrase, you will be using this to log in to your Ubuntu computer.<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6qAnciz.png"></p></li><li>Name your Putty Private Key <strong>.ppk</strong> to <em>myfirstinstance</em> and hit <strong>Save</strong><p><br></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/h1hJp9B.png"></p></li><li>Close Your PuTTy Key Generator and WinSCP</li></ol>
<p>
<strong>Log in to our Ubuntu Server</strong></p>
<ol><li>Run Putty and paste in your Instance's <em>Public IP</em> under Host Name. Port should be Port 22 (Remember the default port number when we first configured our Ubuntu Computer? Yes SSH Port 22!):<p><br></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/21LEblK.png"></p></li><li>Still, on the PuTTy window, expand SSH and click <strong>Auth</strong> and browse for the "<strong>myfirstinstance.ppk</strong>" file.<img src="http://i.imgur.com/BzPgqkX.png" style="background-color: initial;"></li><li>If you don't want to keep doing this step every time you want to log in to your Ubuntu computer, you can scroll up, click Session and save this session as " <em>myfirstinstance</em>", then click <strong>Save.</strong><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TU4DaLh.png"></p></li><li>Now click <strong>Open</strong> to open the PuTTy terminal. Once in the PuTTy console, you will see a text that says "login as:" type in <em>ubuntu</em> as user name (the default username). Then type your "passphrase" we saved earlier (In <strong>Generate a .ppk file</strong> - <em>Step 4</em> above).<br>
