<h1>Razor View Engine</h1>
<p>Now that we're using ASP.NET Core MVC, we have access to the Razor View Engine. The <code>.cshtml</code> file extension we've been using for views actually designates Razor files. Razor allows us to write HTML just as before, but with the added ability to write C# code directly in our views. In addition, we can embed HTML in our embedded C#, and switch between the two as much as we like.</p>
<p>We can put a block of code in our HTML by denoting it with an <code>@</code> followed by curly braces. Inside these blocks we can perform any C# operations we want.</p>
<pre data-language="html" class=" code-toolbar language-html"><code class="  language-html">&lt;body&gt;
    @{
        var StringList = new List&lt;string&gt;{
                                "one",
                                "two",
                                "three",
                                "four"
                            };
        
        foreach(var word in StringList)
        {
            // We can render HTML from within C# code!
            &lt;p&gt;@word&lt;/p&gt;
        }
    }
&lt;/body&gt;
</code><div class="toolbar"></div></pre>
<p>We can write HTML in our C# block and it will be rendered as the C# evaluates when the page is loaded. Note that in order to use the "word" variable inside our HTML we have to preface it with the <code>@</code> symbol again. We can nest C# inside HTML inside C# and so on as much as we like:</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class=" code-toolbar language-csharp"><code class="  language-csharp">&lt;body&gt;
    @foreach(var word in StringList)
    {
       &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;@word&lt;/p&gt;
          @if(word.Length &lt; 4)
          {
             &lt;p&gt;@word is a short word&lt;/p&gt;
          }
       &lt;/div&gt;
    }
&lt;/body&gt;
</code><div class="toolbar"></div></pre>
<p>Any C# operation or method call can be made outside of a C# code block (<code>@{ }</code>) by leading the operation/method call with the <code>@</code>&nbsp;symbol.</p>
