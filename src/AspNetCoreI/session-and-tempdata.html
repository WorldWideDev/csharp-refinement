<h1>Session</h1>
<p>If we want our data to persist across multiple HTTP requests, we're going to need to use session. To enable our web application to use session, we will need to modify our Startup class.
</p>
<h3>Startup.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="active_pre">public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSession();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// add this line
    services.AddMvc();
}
// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    // other configurations
    app.UseSession();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// add this line
    app.UseMvc();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// make sure UseMvc comes last!!
}
</pre>
<p>
    And with that, we have the session available for use in this application.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to the kind of data we can store in session. In ASP.NET Core, session can only hold integers and strings. We have to specify what kind of data the session contains both when we set it and when we retrieve it.
</p>
<p>
    In order to use session in our controller, we need a new using statement:
</p>
<pre data-language="csharp">    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
</pre>
<p>
    And now inside of our controller methods, we can utilize session:</p>
<pre data-language="csharp">// *Inside controller methods*
// To store a string in session we use ".SetString"
// The first string passed is the key and the second is the value we want to retrieve later
HttpContext.Session.SetString("UserName", "Samantha");
// To retrieve a string from session we use ".GetString"
string LocalVariable = HttpContext.Session.GetString("UserName");
 
// To store an int in session we use ".SetInt32"
HttpContext.Session.SetInt32("UserAge", 28);
// To retrieve an int from session we use ".GetInt32"
int? IntVariable = HttpContext.Session.GetInt32("UserAge");
</pre>
<p>
    You may have noticed that when retrieving an int from session we have to store it in an
    <code>int?</code>
    variable, rather than an
    <code>int</code>. This is because
    <code>int</code>
    variables are non-nullable; any given session variable could contain a null value, so we have to use the nullable-int type
    <code>int?</code>.
</p>
<p>
    We can clear our session with the
    <code>Clear</code>
    method:
</p>
<pre data-language="csharp">HttpContext.Session.Clear();</pre>
<h3>Accessing Session in your Views</h3>
<p>
    Unlike some web-frameworks you may have seen (Flask/Django), there is no way to directly access session from within the view-engine.  So, to pass values stored in session to your view, you will need to use either ViewBag or a View Model to give your views access to session data.

    As an example, let's say you are tracking clicks of a button and storing a "count" value in session.
</p>
<pre data-langague="c_sharp">
// in your Controller
ViewBag.Count = HttpContext.Session.GetInt32["count"];
</pre>
<pre data-language="html">
<!-- in your View -->
&lt;h2;&gt;You have clicked the button @ViewBag.Count&lt;h2&gt;
</pre>
<h3>Modifying Session</h3>
<p>Even though the session is only designed to hold simple data types, we can actually customize the session by adding our own methods that can accept something besides an int or string. In the code below, we are writing a class that lets us serialize our objects (basically transform our object into a JSON string) so that we can then store them in session as a string. Then, when we want to retrieve that object out of session, we just need to deserialize it from its string form back to the original object (generalized by <code>T</code>).</p>
<pre data-language="csharp">using Newtonsoft.Json;
// Somewhere in your namespace, outside other classes
public static class SessionExtensions
{
    // We can call ".SetObjectAsJson" just like our other session set methods, by passing a key and a value
    public static void SetObjectAsJson(this ISession session, string key, object value)
    {
        // This helper function simply serializes theobject to JSON and stores it as a string in session
        session.SetString(key, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(value));
    }
       
    // generic type T is a stand-in indicating that we need to specify the type on retrieval
    public static T GetObjectFromJson&lt;T&gt;(this ISession session, string key)
    {
        string value = session.GetString(key);
        // Upon retrieval the object is deserialized based on the type we specified
        return value == null ? default(T) : JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;T&gt;(value);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Once we have the class above in our namespace, we now have 2 additional methods wherever we're using session. Here's an example of how we can use these methods in our controller:</p>
<pre data-language="csharp">// *Inside a controller method*
List&lt;object&gt; NewList = new List&lt;object&gt;();
 
HttpContext.Session.SetObjectAsJson("TheList", NewList);
 
// Notice that we specify the type ( List ) on retrieval
List&lt;object&gt; Retrieve = HttpContext.Session.GetObjectFromJson&lt;List&lt;object&gt;&gt;("TheList");
</pre>
<h4>TempData</h4>
<p>
    Sometimes we want to hold onto simple data through a redirect, but not persist as long as session (think simple error messages).
    <code>TempData</code>&nbsp;does just that--it is like a temporary session that only persists across one redirect. We can store strings or ints in
    <code>TempData</code>&nbsp;and we don't have to worry about that data sticking around and taking up space.
    <code>TempData</code>
    is built on top of session,&nbsp;though, so we cannot use it without enabling session in our application.
</p>
<pre data-language="csharp">using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
 
// Other code
public IActionResult Method()
{
    TempData["Variable"] = "Hello World";
    return RedirectToAction("OtherMethod");
}
public IActionResult OtherMethod()
{
    Console.WriteLine(TempData["Variable"]);
    // writes "Hello World" if redirected to from Method()
}
</pre>
