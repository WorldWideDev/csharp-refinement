<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>We should practice our ability of including static files such as CSS, JS, or IMGs. To do this we are going to create a simple portfolio website that contains 3 key pages. These pages will be a <strong>home page</strong> that is mostly personal information, <strong>a projects page</strong> that lists various projects you have worked on, and <strong>a contact page</strong> with a form where people visiting your website can send you information. There will also be a navbar at the top of each of these pages with buttons that will allow you to navigate to the various other pages.&nbsp;For this assignment, it is critical to be adding CSS styling to each page and using only images that are stored on your local server in the wwwroot directory!</p>
