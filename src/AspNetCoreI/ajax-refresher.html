<h1>AJAX Refresher</h1>
<h2>What is AJAX?</h2>
<p>In our web applications thus far, we are utilizing the traditional request-response cycle, in which a client makes a request, and we send back a response (i.e. HTML/CSS/JS) which is fully rendered to the client. AJAX is a technique that allows the client to interact with a page and have the page get updated without being reloaded entirely. Instead of expecting a full HTML/CSS/JS response, an AJAX request works best when it receives a JSON response. Once the response is received, the DOM can be manipulated without a full page refresh. Querying our own routes that return JSON is no different from querying external APIs!</p>
<h2>AJAX with JQuery</h2>
<p>While we could make these AJAX requests with Vanilla JavaScript, the JQuery library makes these requests much simpler. For the full documentation, you can look <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" target="_blank">here</a>. There are also 2 shorthand functions for making <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/" target="_blank">get</a> or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/" target="_blank">post</a> requests, which are a little bit simpler to use. Basically, the format is:</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" class="code-toolbar language-javascript">
    <code class="language-javascript">
        //what event should trigger each of these methods?

        // to make a GET request
        // the first argument is the string of the URL that will return JSON
        // the second argument is a callback function that specifies what you want to do once the data from the specified URL is returned
        $.get("localhost:5000/cats", function (data) {
            // data refers to the results of the GET request to localhost:5000/cats; what do you think your "cats" GET method should return?
            // DOM manipulation!
        })
        
        // to make a POST request
        // the first argument is the string of the URL that will return JSON
        // the second argument is a JSON object of the data to post
        // the third argument is a callback function that specifies what you want to do once the POST request is complete
        $(.post("localhost:5000/cats", {name: "Fitz", breed: "domestic short-haired"}, function (data) {
            // data refers to the results of the POST request to localhost:5000/cats; what do you think your "cats" POST method should return?
            // DOM manipulation!
        }))
    </code>
