<h1>Serving View Files</h1>
<p>
The most common return type for our controllers is a view, and ASP.NET Core makes serving them a breeze. Any time one of our Controllers returns a View, the framework attempts to use the name of your controller to find the appropriate view file. ASP.NET looks for a folder called "Views", then looks for a folder that matches the name of your controller, and if it fails to find the view there it will always look for a folder called <code>Shared</code> as a last resort.</p>
<p><strong><em>Make sure your Views subfolders have names that match your controller names</em></strong>(Without "Controller")</p>
<p>For example <code>UsersController</code> would look for its views in the <code>Users</code> subfolder. If a view needs to be rendered from multiple Controllers it must be in the <code>Shared</code> folder.&nbsp;Even though we're only working with static HTML, we'll&nbsp;have an easier time&nbsp;using&nbsp;<code>.cshtml</code> files. ASP.NET Core Mvc will not read standard <code>.html</code> files without some extra configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's make some content to display. Create a new folder called <code>Views</code> in your project directory, then make a subfolder that matches your controller name. Inside the subfolder add a new file called "index.cshtml"</p>

<h3>Index.cshtml</h3>
<pre data-language="html" class="active_pre rainbow">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset='utf-8'&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Hello!&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello ASP.NET Mvc!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Now we need to tell our controller to actually serve the view.
</p>
<h3>HelloController.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace YourNamespace.Controllers
{
    public class HelloController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        [Route("")]
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
            //OR
            return View("Index");
            //Both of these returns will render the same view (You only need one!)
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
ASP.NET Core MVC is very flexible when it comes to designating our targeted view. If we have an empty <code>View()</code> then it will look for a view with the same name as the method serving the view. We can also specify the name of the file (without <code>.cshtml</code>) to render.
