<h1>Controllers</h1>
<p>The controllers will be where we manage routing. All controllers must be found in a folder called <code>Controllers</code>. A good rule of thumb is to have a separate controller for each major kind of model our application will handle. For example, a "UsersController" should handle creating users, logging in/out, etc, while a "ProductsController" would be responsible for creating and modifying products. For our first example, we'll just have a controller called "HelloController":</p>

<p>The basic structure of each controller file will look like this:</p>
<h3>HelloController.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

    namespace YourNamespace.Controllers     //be sure to use your own project's namespace!
    {
        public class HelloController : Controller   //remember inheritance??
        {
            //for each route this controller is to handle:

            [HttpGet]       //type of request
            [Route("")]     //associated route string (exclude the leading /)
            public string Index()
            {
                return "Hello World from HelloController!";
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>While this may seem like a lot, you've seen most of this code before! HelloController is simply a class inheriting from the MVC Controller class -- there's a lot going on that we don't have to worry about because our parent Controller class knows generally what a controller should do! Index is simply a method that returns a string.</p>
<p>The only new pieces here are the two lines in square brackets above the Index method. These are known as <em>decorators</em>, which are placed directly above the method or attribute with which they are to be associated. There are lots of different types of decorators, but these two particularly are a simple, elegant way to associate a particular request method type and route to a specific method.</p>
<p>The [Route] decorator accepts a string argument that represents the route string associated with a given method. For example, <code>[Route("index")]</code> matches the URL <code>localhost:5000/index</code>. They do <strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;have leading slashes.</p>

<!-- I think it's confusing to switch between different types of routing this early on; I think we should just stick with the Route decorator for now -->
