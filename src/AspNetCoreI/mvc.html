<h1>Adding MVC</h1>
<p>We now have a working web server that is able to display text like "Hello World" on the web! The problem ends up being that all of our logic continues to live in the Program.cs and Startup.cs files. As we continue to grow our web applications this system simply is not going to work as these files would quickly become unwieldy. To combat this early, we are going to add the MVC structure to our applications! MVC will allow us to break out different components of our app into nicely sectioned class-based files. Lucky for us, ASP.NET Core was built very much with MVC in mind!</p>
<p>Do you remember where we go to configure our application? In the Startup class, we'll need to do two things to configure this piece of middleware. First, we need to tell our application that we'll be using the MVC service (more on services later!). Then we need to tell it when we want to actually use that service:</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="active_pre rainbow">
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddMvc();  //add this line
    }
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
    {
        // some code removed for brevity
        app.UseMvc();   //add this line, replacing the app.run lines of code
    }
</pre>
<p>As with any framework, if we want to use it, we have to follow its rules. The rest of this chapter will go over the different pieces we need for the ASP.NET Core MVC framework to function as intended.</p>
