<p>For this assignment we will be using the PokeApi, which is a quite simple external API that does not require a key to access. A link to the Api website can be found below:</p>
<p><a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank">PokeApi</a></p>
<p>Create a web page that grabs an ID number from the URL and displays the following information about the corresponding Pokemon: Your page should show the Pokemon's name, types, height and weight.</p>
<ul><li>Name</li><li>Primary Type</li><li>Height</li><li>Weight</li></ul>
<p>Remember, API response objects come in many configurations. Be prepared to dig deeper into the json to find the information you want.&nbsp;<strong>Hint: the vscode debugger is your friend here!</strong></p>
