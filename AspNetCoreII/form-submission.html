<h1>Validating Form Submission</h1>
<p>We need to apply the concepts of Models and Model validations that we learned from the past two tabs.&nbsp;Make a small app that runs validations on a variety of form fields. Use Data Annotations and Models to generate your error messages. Errors should be rendered for each field that submits invalid data. This app is a similar process to that of Dojo Survey just making sure to focus in on these new concepts!</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Create a form that accepts the displayed fields</p></li><li>
<p>Build a User model (object) that reflects each of these fields with all proper validations</p></li><li>
<p>If any of the validations fail, redirecting back to the form page and displaying the relevant errors makes a lot of sense. However, do not spend too much time trying to get this to work. &nbsp;Instead, it would be just as appropriate to load a new&nbsp;view from your Method&nbsp;that handles the form data.</p></li><li>
<p>If there are no errors,&nbsp;display a success page instead!</p></li></ul>
