<h1>Movie API</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">The Movie Database API</a></p>
<p>
Using The Movie DB create a responsive one-page app that allows the user to search for movies by title. Save the result to the database&nbsp;and then all results should be shown to the user. If a query returns more than one result only the first should be saved. Both the form submission and updating the display should be handled with AJAX.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the PokeApi, The Movie DB requires an API key to be accessed. Visit the TMDB website for instructions on how to obtain a key and guides on how to query their API.
