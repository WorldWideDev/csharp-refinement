<h1>Calling Apis from the Backend</h1>
<p>
In the past, we've made API calls from the frontend using jQuery but we can also make them from the backend. Depending on the situation there are advantages to using one method or the other. Frontend API calls take the weight off the server and are appropriate when we don't care how often an HttpRequest is made. On the other hand, when we're dealing with a sensitive API access key, we don't want to expose it where users can see it. This is when backend API calls become important. In addition, if we're using a free API and only have a limited number of times we can access it per day or hour, it may be a good idea to make a backend call and cache the results rather than repeating that call for every user.
</p>
<p>
Each API we query will return data in its own specific configuration; sometimes the top level collection will be a javascript object, sometimes an array, sometimes an API will return XML information. How you handle the return data will differ for each individual API, so you will have to tailor your query method as appropriate. Here is an example of a request method that queries the PokeAPI:

    public class WebRequest
    {
        // The second parameter is a function that returns a Dictionary of string keys to object values.

            {
                try
                {
                    Client.BaseAddress = new Uri($"http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{PokeId}");
                    HttpResponseMessage Response = await Client.GetAsync(""); // Make the actual API call.
                    Response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); // Throw error if not successful.
                    string StringResponse = await Response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); // Read in the response as a string.
                     
                    // Then parse the result into JSON and convert to a dictionary that we can use.
                    // DeserializeObject will only parse the top level object, depending on the API we may need to dig deeper and continue deserializing
                    Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; JsonResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;&gt;(StringResponse);
                     
                    // Finally, execute our callback, passing it the response we got.
                    Callback(JsonResponse);
                }
                catch (HttpRequestException e)
                {
                    // If something went wrong, display the error.
                    Console.WriteLine($"Request exception: {e.Message}");
                }

<h2>Async</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that the "GetPokemonDataAsync" method has a couple new keywords in its signature: "async" and "Task". These keywords are required in order to make a method asynchronous. Our regular methods all run on a single thread, meaning that each method must finish its execution before another can start. Asynchronous methods open a new thread when they are executed, allowing them to run simultaneously to our main thread or other asynchronous methods. Because API querying method calls asynchronous methods, it must be asynchronous as well; a synchronous method perform asynchronous operations. All asynchronous methods must return a <code>Task</code> object which represents the asynchronous process that is still running. The <code>await</code> keyword is used to force the main thread to wait until a <code>Task</code> is finished executing.</p>
<p>
With this or any similar method we can call it from our controllers, using a lambda callback to handle the return:
</p>
<h3>YourController.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="csharp" class=" code-toolbar language-csharp"><code class="  language-csharp">[HttpGet]
[Route("pokemon/{pokeid}")]
public IActionResult QueryPoke(int pokeid)
{
    var PokeInfo = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();
    WebRequest.GetPokemonDataAsync(pokeid, ApiResponse =&gt;
        {
            PokeInfo = ApiResponse;
        }
    ).Wait();
    // Other code
}
</code><div class="toolbar"></div></pre>
<p>
Even though "GetPokemonDataAsync" is asynchronous, we can force it to run synchronously by calling the <code>.Wait()</code> method available to all asynchronous methods. When we use <code>.Wait()</code> with async methods we do&nbsp;lose the benefits of asynchronous processing. This is acceptable in situations when our main thread needs the async operation to complete before it can continue in any case.</p>
