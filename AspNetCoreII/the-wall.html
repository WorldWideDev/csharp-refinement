<h2>The Wall</h2>
<p>Now that we have created an assignment where a user can register and login to our site, let's combine this idea with our previous messaging assignment "Quoting Dojo". Create a wall/forum page where users will be able to post a message and see the message displayed by other users. Store the messages in a table called 'messages' and retrieve the messages from the database. Have a Login and Registration page. After logging in, the user is directed to The Wall.</p>

<p>Once you got the messages to show up like on the wireframe on the left side, allow users to post comments for any message. Store the replies/comments to the message in a separate table called 'comments'.</p>
<ul><li>Extra Credit I (optional): allow the user to delete his/her own message.</li><li>Extra Credit II (optional): allow the user to delete his/her own message but only if the message was made in the last 30 minutes.</li></ul>
<p>Finish the assignment and upload your code below.</p>
