<h1>Custom Validations</h1>
<p>Built-in validations are pretty great! But we may run into a situation that requires more customized, specific validations. Thanks to the power of some OOP principles like inheritance, adding your own validations is actually pretty straightforward!</p>
<p>While you may not have realized it, each of the built-in validations inherits from an abstract class called ValidationAttribute, which was written by the developers of the ASP.NET Core framework. Back in OOP, you may have wondered why you would ever use an abstract class, and here is a perfect example.</p>
<p>By having all validations inherit from this class, the framework is able to say "run all ValidationAttributes," instead of "run all RangeAttributes, then MinLengthAttributes, then MaxLengthAttributes, then...". As we add new validation requirements to our models, the code for running model validations remains the same!</p>
<p>Remember that an abstract class can't be instantiated directly, which is exactly what we want here. Because every validation requires specific logic, there isn't really a general validation to instantiate. Instead, the abstract class only provides guidance for what inheriting members must do. There should be an IsValid method with one of the following signatures:</p>
<pre data-language="chsharp" class="rainbow active_pre">public abstract class ValidationAttribute : Attribute
{
    public virtual bool IsValid(object value);
    protected virtual ValidationResult IsValid(object value, ValidationContext validationContext);
}
</pre>
<p>Where the first method returns a boolean, choosing the second implementation allows for the return of a more complex object, a ValidationResult, which allows us to include an error message to the associated field.</p>
<p>Here's how we can extend this class to make our own ValidationAttribute. Note the two arguments here. <strong>value </strong>is the form data that is being validated, and <strong>validationContext</strong> contains information about the entire request, including all other fields that were submitted.<br></p>
<pre data-language="chsharp" class="rainbow">public class NoZNamesAttribute : ValidationAttribute
{
    protected override ValidationResult IsValid(object value, ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        if((string)value.ToLower()[0] == 'z')
            return new ValidationResult("No names that start with Z allowed!");

        return ValidationResult.Success;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>And just like that, we can now apply this attribute class to one of our model's fields based on the name we gave to the class (excluding the word "Attribute"), just as we did with built-in validations:</p>
<pre data-language="chsharp" class="rainbow">public class User
{
    [NoZNames]
    public string FirstName {get;set;}
}
</pre>
