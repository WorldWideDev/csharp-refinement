<h1>Interfaces</h1>
<p>In C# we have already seen this idea of abstraction with class inheritance and polymorphism, where multiple classes such as Car and Boat that inherit from a similar parent class of Vehicle can both be treated as that more generic parent class. Abstraction with C# when dealing with classes is quite important to allow flexibility while also providing structure to how various objects are related. This could essentially be thought of as grouping these objects.</p>
<p>In addition to inheritance, there is another way to group classes together. Where inheritance defines a hierarchy of parent/child relationships, an <strong>interface</strong> can be used to provide a shared set of <em>behavior</em> between any class - regardless of their inheritance chain! An interface is defined somewhat similarly to a class, however rather than providing a blueprint to what an object <em>is</em>, an interface describes what an object <em>is able to do</em>.</p>

<p>First, let's see an example of an interface we can define.  And then, we can <em>implement</em> this interface on two (or more) classes that would otherwise be unrelated, which will demonstrate the power of why interfaces are important.</p>
<h2>Defining an Interface</h2>
<p>We will define an interface that describes the ability to <strong>ride</strong>.  Within this interface we will include methods and properties that will form a set of requirements that a class must possess for it to be "rideable".  We will say that for a class to be "rideable" it must have a <code>Ride()</code> method, and a property that describes its overall "distance traveled".</p>
<h4>Method "Signatures"</h4>
<p>Methods we provide to an interface won't be fully built out, we just provide a method signature which is comprised of: a <strong>return type</strong>, a <strong>method name</strong>, and any <strong>input parameters</strong>, followed by a semi-colon.  We aren't building out methods, only describing what they are.  For example:</p>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
// method signature:
void ExampleMethod(string parameterA, int parameterB);
</pre>
<p>The full implementation of interface methods will be carried out on classes that implement the interface, and done so in a way that can be specific unique to that class.</p>
<h3>IRideable.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
// common naming convention for interfaces:
// capital I + DescriptionOfBehavior
interface IRideable
{
    // any class that implements "IRideable", must have the following methods/properties
    &nbsp;
    // in interfaces, "method signatures" are used.
    // this means that there is no body to this method,
    // only its return type, name, and parameters
    void Ride(double distance);

    &nbsp;
    // properties can also be used in interfaces (fields can not)
    double DistanceTraveled {get;set;}
}
</pre>
<h2>Implementing Interfaces</h2>
<p>Now that we have defined our interface, we can go about implementing it on a few classes.  The interface itself is often thought of as a "contract" that must be fulfilled by any class we choose to "implement" this interface.  This means we must implement <em>all</em> interface members on the class before our code will compile.  Also, when we implement the contained interface members (<code>Ride()</code> and <code>DistanceTraveled</code>), we must make them <code>public</code>.  This is because we will want to be able to group objects by their interface type, and have access to the members contained in that interface.  Let's start by implementing IRideable on our Car class.</p>
<h3>Car.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
// "implementing" an interface on a class looks much like "inheriting" from another
class Car : Vehicle, IRideable
{
    // all previous code for Car ...
    &nbsp;
    // we can use DistanceTraveled to be a wrapper for "Odometer"
    public double DistanceTraveled
    {
        get { return Odometer; }
        set { Odometer = value; }
    }
    public void Ride(double distance)
    {
        // here we can choose implement this method however we wish
        // as long as we meet the requirements of the method
        Console.WriteLine("... driving ...");
        DistanceTraveled += distance;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Now that we have made Car "rideable", we can see the full power of interfaces by attaching the IRideable interface to a class otherwise completely unrelated to Cars and Vehicles.  For example, let's say we wanted a Horse class (a Horse, while certainly not a "vehicle", should most definitely be "rideable").</p>
<h3>Horse.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Horse : IRideable
{
    // a horse can have its own unique attributes
    public string Name;
    public double Endurance;
    &nbsp;
    // implementing DistanceTraveled a bit differently from a Car,
    // only requirement here, is that it has a property for DistanceTraveled
    public double DistanceTraveled {get;set;}
    &nbsp;
    public Horse(string name, double endurance)
    {
        Name = name;
        Endurance = endurance;
        DistanceTraveled = 0;
    }
    // implementing Ride, again, a bit differently from a Car
    // a Horse can only go so far as its endurance will allow
    public void Ride(double distance)
    {
        if(distance >= Endurance)
            distance = Endurance;
        Console.WriteLine("... riding, heeeyahhh ...");
        DistanceTraveled += distance;
    }
}
</pre>
<h2>Polymorphism and Interfaces</h2>
<p>By implementing our interface on a wide set of classes, we are able to group objects together based on the interface type!  By doing so, we have access to the shared set of interface members common to the classes that have implemented IRideable.  One way to see this is by grouping a set of objects together in a List/array of IRideable objects.</p>
<h3>Program.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IRideable[] variousRideables = new IRideable[]
        {
            new Car("Yellow", "Dodge", "Dart"),
            new Car("Green", "Ford", "Fiesta"),
            new Horse("Silver Queen", 100),
            new Horse("Samammish", 75),
        };
        // let them all ride!
        foreach(var rideable in variousRideables)
        {
            // each "rideable" object will be able to invoke the common "Ride()" method
            // however the implementation of "Ride()" will be unique to how each class has chosen to build it
            rideable.Ride(50);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>This example demonstrates one way objects can be grouped together by a common interface type, albeit in a bit of a contrived example.  Perhaps a more demonstrative use-case would be if we wanted to give a Person class something to ride.  Our interface gives a great deal of flexibility in this manner.</p>
<h3>Person.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Person
{
    public string Name;
    // Any class that implements IRideable can be used!
    public IRideable Transport;
    public double Miles;
    public Person(string name, IRideable trans)
    {
        Name = name;
        Transport = trans;
        Miles = 0;
    }
    // Person can make use of the capabilities of their "transport"
    public void GoSomewhere(double miles)
    {
        Transport.Ride(miles);
        Miles += Transport.DistanceTraveled;
    }
    public void GetInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Miles Traveled: {Miles}");
    }
}
</pre>
<pre data-language="c_sharp">
class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Horse wilbur = new Horse("Wilbur", 120);
        Car volvo = new Car("Yellow", "Volvo", "240");
        &nbsp;
        // sally starts out with a horse
        Person sally = new Person("Sally", wilbur);
        // sally can ride her horse
        sally.GoSomewhere(34);
        &nbsp;
        // we can also change her Transport to a Car
        sally.Transport = volvo;
        sally.GoSomewhere(100);
        sally.GetInfo();
    }
}
