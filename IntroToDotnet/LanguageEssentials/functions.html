<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>A function is a <strong> name that is related to a block of code we can execute</strong>. To execute this code, we invoke it. A function is invoked when we<strong> call its name, pass along the necessary input, it will&nbsp;execute&nbsp;the block of code and usually give us back some kind of&nbsp;output</strong>.&nbsp;Some functions take no input and some functions have no output. Even though a function doesn't return anything, it can do something inside the block of code that alters a program.&nbsp;For example:</p>
<pre data-language="swift" class=" code-toolbar  language-swift"><code class="  language-swift">public static void SayHello()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello how are you doing today?");
}
</code><div class="toolbar"><div class="toolbar-item">Copy</div></div></pre>
<p>Here we defined a function with the accessibility level of public, declared as a static member, has a return type of void,&nbsp;declared its name to be <em>S</em><em>ay</em><em>Hello</em>, and specified that this function does not take in any arguments. When this function is invoked, it will print a greeting to the screen but it will not return anything.</p>
<h2>Accessibility Levels</h2>
<p>To walk through these various parts the accessibility level controls what other parts of the program have access to invoke the function. Public specifies that the function is fully accessible from any part of the program that can see the file it is written in. Private restricts a function to only be called from within the same scope as its definition.&nbsp;If we leave out the accessibility&nbsp;keyword, functions default&nbsp;to being private. We will be getting more in depth into function accessibility and the other types that exists out there, but for now it is safe to assume every function we will be creating can be prefixed with the <strong>public</strong>&nbsp;keyword.</p>
<h2>Static?</h2>
<p>The next part of this is the single optional keyword of <strong>static</strong>. Static controls how we can invoke a function in our code; a static function can be called within the scope of its definition&nbsp;or by calling it on the class it's defined in, while a non-static method has to be called on an instance of an object. We'll talk&nbsp;more about instantiating objects when we learn about Classes, for now all of our functions will be static.<strong></strong></p>
<h2>Invoking a Function</h2>
<p>When we want to invoke this function in a .NET console application we need to be aware of a few things. First, the function must be placed outside of the Main function, but still inside the Program class. This is because C# code can only see other code written within the same class by default.&nbsp;C# does not support embedding of functions so the new function we add must be&nbsp;separate.&nbsp; Once built however the new function can be run by <strong>calling its name inside the Main function and passing in the necessary input</strong>. In this case, the function requires no input so we won't pass anything in. This function doesn't return anything, but it will have a side effect of printing something to the <strong>Terminal Console</strong>.</p>
<pre data-language="swift" class=" code-toolbar  language-swift"><code class="  language-swift">using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void SayHello()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello how are you doing today?");
        }
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            SayHello();
        }
    }
}
</code><div class="toolbar"><div class="toolbar-item">Copy</div></div></pre>
<h2>Function Parameters</h2>
<div>We define what kind of input we want by <strong> declaring parameters.</strong> Let's declare a parameter named "name"&nbsp;that will be of Type&nbsp;string. Our function will still not return anything but its output&nbsp;will be a little bit more personalized. Note that we need to not only <strong>declare a parameter name but also specify the parameter's type.</strong>
</div>
<pre data-language="swift" class=" code-toolbar  language-swift"><code class="  language-swift">public static void SayHello(string name)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, {0}, how are you doing today?", name);
}
</code><div class="toolbar"><div class="toolbar-item">Copy</div></div></pre>
<p>We can invoke this function by calling its name and passing in the correct number of arguments.</p>
<pre data-language="swift" class=" code-toolbar  language-swift"><code class="  language-swift">SayHello("Andrew");
</code><div class="toolbar"><div class="toolbar-item">Copy</div></div></pre>
<p>Wait, what's the difference between a parameter and an argument? These two words get mixed up a lot in programming. In this example, "<strong>name"&nbsp;is a parameter </strong>while <strong>"Andrew" is an argument</strong>. We <strong>define parameters.</strong> We <strong>pass in arguments</strong> into functions.</p>
<h2>Default Parameter Values</h2>
<p>It's good to have default parameter values sometimes. Let's revisit our SayHello function. If we don't know the name of the person that we are greeting we can have a default value to go with. For example, we can just say "Hey, buddy."</p>
<pre data-language="swift" class=" code-toolbar  language-swift"><code class="  language-swift">public static void SayHello(string name = "buddy")
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hey " + name);
}
// We can call it without providing any arguments and the default value will be used...
SayHello();
// ...or we can call it with an argument and that argument's value will be used
SayHello("Yoda");
</code><div class="toolbar"><div class="toolbar-item">Copy</div></div></pre>
<h2>Return</h2>
<p>The final piece of a function definition&nbsp;is the return type. When we write functions in C# we must specify what datatype, if any, the function will return. By now you've surely noticed the word "void" in all of our function definitions. Void is a keyword that signifies that the function has no return. In many cases, we would want our function to return some sort of value that we can use later in our program. Let's modify our <em>sayHello</em> function and observe the differences:</p>
<pre data-language="swift" class=" code-toolbar  language-swift"><code class="  language-swift">public static string SayHello(string name = "buddy")
{
    return $"Hey {name}";
}
string greeting;
greeting = SayHello();
Console.WriteLine(greeting);
</code><div class="toolbar"><div class="toolbar-item">Copy</div></div></pre>
<p>This version of <em>SayHello&nbsp;</em>specifies <code>string</code> as the return type. We call <em>SayHello </em>and store the value it returns in the <em>greeting </em>variable, which is also of type string.</p>
