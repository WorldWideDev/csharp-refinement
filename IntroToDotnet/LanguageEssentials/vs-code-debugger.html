<h1>Debugging</h1>
<p>Omnisharp&nbsp;and VS Code&nbsp;use&nbsp;a very powerful tool called <strong>a&nbsp;debugger</strong>. A debugger allows us to stop our code at a specified line during execution, and then step through it one line at a time to observe the various states of execution. While WriteLine statements can be useful, the debugger should be your go to tool for handling runtime and logical errors. The use of the debugger&nbsp;is paramount; it is an industry standard&nbsp;that facilitates&nbsp;methodical&nbsp;bug-fixing, line-by-line.</p>

<!-- flesh out this example a little bit more; teaching debugger piece at a time? -->
<p>Have you tried printing an array or a list to the console? Was it maybe not what you were expecting to see? Now try to use the debugger to see what your array or list looks like.</p>
