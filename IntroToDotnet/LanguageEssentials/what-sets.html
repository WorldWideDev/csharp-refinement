<h1>The C# Language</h1>
<p>In the ASP.NET Core course, we will use the <strong>C#</strong> programming language&nbsp;almost&nbsp;exclusively (as with any web stack, JavaScript can never <em>truly</em> be excluded). What is it that sets C# apart from other languages we have learned, such as Python or JavaScript?</p>
<h2>Compiled vs Interpreted</h2>
<p>

<p>One of the foremost advantages of a compiled language is that the compilation process includes an analysis of the source code, converting it into something that has been (mostly) verified and is ready to go -- versus interpreted code that receives no attention until the moment when it needs to run. Compilers can do all sorts of checks, which can immediately catch bugs that would show up at execution time as crashes or strange behavior. Other checks might expose strange corner-case bugs that might only occur intermittently; without a compiler, these would be very difficult to discover and debug manually. Since compiling&nbsp;of code is a one-time event and does not need constant listening and evaluation like interpreting, that compiled block or executable can simply be shipped out and run by any platform that understands it, with no additional work needed. Compiling takes some time, it is true, but the payback comes with speed and efficiency at runtime. A compiler is built by a full engineering team that methodically plans and abides by all safety procedures vs the DIY Mad scientist at home that just straps rockets to things. The former might take longer to get going, but may prove to be faster and is definitely less likely to explode.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Static Typing</h2>
<p>Most compiled languages use static typing, and this holds true for C# as well. Static typing essentially means that the language needs to know what type is associated with a variable before it ever gets defined, to try to avoid later placing the wrong data into a container. Dynamic typing, on the other hand, does this on the fly while the variable is in the process of being used.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have 2 friends -- static language and dynamic language -- and you're planning a picnic with them. When you plan the picnic with your <em>static</em> friend, he immediately begins texting you questions -- really detailed questions -- like <em>on the date of the picnic how much gasoline do you plan on having in your car</em>&nbsp;or <em>what kind of material is the picnic blanket going to be</em> (it better be natural fiber!) or <em>exactly how many forks and spoons are you bringing&nbsp;and what are they made of</em>, etc. This process may seem a bit tedious, but when it comes time to go on the picnic, all the details have already been ironed out. When you plan a picnic with your <em>dynamic</em> friend, they ask comparatively general questions and they are happy to go with the flow, and they say you can drive, I'll bring the food. There may be some speed bumps along the way&nbsp;and the picnic might not go as&nbsp;expected (such as <em>I brought soup and I kinda figured you would bring spoons -- did you?</em>). That said, your Dynamic friend is always ready to go with the flow.</p>
<h2>History and Stability</h2>
<p>C# is very mature as far as current popular web languages go.&nbsp;When we talk about maturity, it's not just age but also&nbsp;stability&nbsp;with it not&nbsp;going through constant version changes. C# has been around for 16+ years now, with it having been stationed on the last stable full version release for over a year.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;also&nbsp;built completely in-house for&nbsp;Microsoft and, as such, has tons of support and documentation&nbsp;available&nbsp;for it. .NET framework in particular also has a <strong>HUGE</strong>&nbsp;standard library. If you don't believe us on that check it out for yourself!</p>

 <strong>So you may find yourself asking why is this, therefore, any different or better than something like C++ or Java</strong></p>
<h2>Modern and Simple</h2>
<p>C# is Microsoft's flagship language. Anything they can do to keep it up to date and easy to work with, they will. As such the latest version comes fully equipped with many awesome features such as Garbage Collection, Generics, Implicit variable type declaration, Async calls, and advanced OOP structures. C# also sets out to be non-verbose, easy to read, and productive when writing code -- all of which are things C++ and Java sometimes fall short with. C# strives to become the best of both worlds.</p>
