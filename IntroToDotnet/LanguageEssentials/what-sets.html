<h1>The C# Language</h1>
<p>In the ASP.NET Core course, we will use the <strong>C#</strong> programming language almost exclusively. What is it that sets C# apart from other languages we have learned, such as Python or JavaScript?</p>
<h2>Compiled vs Interpreted</h2>
<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3758/handouts/chapter3758_7104_compiling.png"></p>
<p>One of the foremost advantages of a compiled language is that the compilation process includes an analysis of the source code, converting it into something that has been (mostly) verified and is ready to go. In contrast, interpreted code receives no attention until the moment when it needs to run. Compilers can do all sorts of checks, which can immediately catch bugs that would show up as crashes or strange behavior at execution time. Other checks might expose strange corner-case bugs that might only occur intermittently; without a compiler, these would be very difficult to discover and debug manually.</p>
<p>While compiling does take some time up front, the payback comes with speed and efficiency at runtime. Since the compilation of code is a one-time event, it does not need constant listening and evaluation like interpreting. It can simply be shipped out and run by any platform that understands it, with no additional work.</p>
<h2>Static Typing</h2>
<p>Most compiled languages use static typing, and this holds true for C# as well. Static typing essentially means that when declaring any variable, its type (i.e. string, number, list, etc.) must be specified immediately and cannot be changed after declaration. Dynamic typing, on the other hand, does this on the fly while the variable is in the process of being used.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have 2 friends -- static language and dynamic language -- and you're planning a picnic with them. When you plan the picnic with your <em>static</em> friend, he immediately begins texting you questions -- <em>on the date of the picnic how much gasoline do you plan on having in your car?</em> or <em>what kind of material is the picnic blanket going to be?</em> or <em>exactly how many forks and spoons are you bringing and what are they made of?</em> This process may seem a bit tedious, but when it comes time to go on the picnic, all the details have already been ironed out. When you plan a picnic with your <em>dynamic</em> friend, they may ask a few questions but are happy to go with the flow -- they say you can drive, I'll bring the food. There may be some speed bumps along the way and the picnic might not go as expected (<em>I brought soup and I kinda figured you would bring spoons -- did you?</em>). That said, your Dynamic friend is always ready to go with the flow.</p>
<h2>History and Stability</h2>
<p>C# is very mature as far as current popular web languages go. When we talk about maturity, we consider not only its age, but also its stability (i.e. not going through constant version changes). While the framework we're using is relatively new, the C# language itself is stable and more than 16 years old. It was also built completely in-house for Microsoft and, as such, has tons of support and documentation. The .NET framework in particular also has a <strong>HUGE</strong> standard library.

 <strong>So you may find yourself asking why this is any different, or better than, something like C++ or Java</strong></p>
<h2>Modern and Simple</h2>
<p>C# is Microsoft's flagship language. Anything they can do to keep it up to date and easy to work with, they will. The latest version comes fully equipped with many awesome features such as Garbage Collection, Generics, Implicit variable type declaration, Async calls, and advanced OOP structures. C# also sets out to be non-verbose, easy to read, and productive when writing code -- which can sometimes be the shortcomings of C++ or Java. C# strives to become the best of both worlds.</p>
