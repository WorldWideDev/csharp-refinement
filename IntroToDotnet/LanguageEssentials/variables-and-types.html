<h1>Variables</h1>
<p>
As mentioned in the previous tab, C# deals with variables slightly differently than languages such as Javascript or Python, because it uses static typing. This basically means that all variables declared in C# must have a value type associated with them at the time of declaration.</p>
<p>
In JavaScript, we can create different variables without ever specifying a type because the runtime&nbsp;will&nbsp;do this for us.</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">var name = "Tim";
var age = 30;
var height = 1.905;
var blueEyed = false;
</pre>
<p>
In C# though, we must make sure that the compiler is able to determine the type of each variable while building the project.</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">string name = "Todd";
int age = 32;
double height = 1.875;
bool blueEyed = true;
</pre>
<p>
With C# if we forget to specify a variable type the compiler will quickly throw us an error. Similarly, if you attempt to assign a value to a variable that does not conform to its specified type the compiler will come back with a type-mismatch error. Below is a chart of some of the primitive types that exist in C# along with&nbsp;a description of their use case,&nbsp;size of the memory space they occupy, and example values stored.</p>

<h3>This is a headache! Why is C# strongly typed?</h3>
<h4>One word: Performance</h4>
<p>Although loosely typed languages may be easier for the developer initially, it reduces performance because the computer has to worry about remembering types and how to store different values of different types. In addition, the computer now has to allocate extra space for each variable and it has to store them in such a way that the variable can hold any type of information. Because C# is strongly typed, it forces the developer to be more conscious about types and allows the computer to run more efficiently by allocating just enough space for each variable.</p>
