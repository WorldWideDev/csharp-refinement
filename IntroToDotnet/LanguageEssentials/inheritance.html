<h1>Inheritance</h1>
<p>We have been building out our Vehicle class quite a bit in previous examples in the classes tab, let's now take it a step further and start specializing our different vehicles. By taking the generic code already in place and adding different details we can create things like a Bike, Car, or Boat from our Vehicle class, into their own separate classes, without repeating necessary code, by making these new classes <strong>inherit</strong> from Vehicle. When one class inherits from another it gains all the properties and methods of the parent class. In C# each class can only inherit from one other class, although any number of classes can inherit from any given class. Any properties or methods that a class inherits will also be passed to its child classes. This sequence of passing information down through multiple levels of classes is called the <strong>inheritance chain<strong>.</strong></strong>

{
    public int NumberOfWheels = 4;
    public string Condition;
    public Car() : base(5)
    {
        Condition = "New";
    }
    public Car(double odo) : base(5, odo)
    {
        Condition = "Used";

        Car oldCar = new Car(167263);
        Console.WriteLine($"Car Condition: {oldCar.Condition}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Max occupancy: {oldCar.NumPassengers}");
        oldCar.Move(6);
        Console.WriteLine($"Current Milage: {oldCar.Distance} miles");
        Car myCar = new Car();
        //Remember there are different forms of string construction
        //but they all accomplish the same goal so it is simply preference
        Console.WriteLine($"Car Condition: {myCar.Condition}");
        Console.WriteLine("Max occupancy: {0}", myCar.NumPassengers);
        myCar.Move(26.6);
        Console.WriteLine("Current Milage: " + myCar.Distance + " miles");
    }
}

<p>
The base keyword following&nbsp;the new class constructor is done to pass the needed variables to the parent class' constructor methods. The parent class's constructor will be run, and then the child class's&nbsp;constructor will execute. Because of this, we can keep all the properties and functionality of the parent class while still having the ability to add to or overwrite them.
Method Overriding
</p>
<p>
It's great that we can inherit functionality from our parent class as well as add new functionality, but what if we want to change the functionality of one of these parent methods? The process for this is actually quite simple! If we just add a method to our new class that has the same name and parameters as a parent's, the child class method will take priority.</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="active_pre rainbow">public class Vehicle
{
    //All past code for the Car Vehicle
    //should still be present
    public void GetInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is just a basic Vehicle!");
        Console.WriteLine($"Currently has travelled {Distance} miles");
    }
}
public class Car : Vehicle
{
    //All past code for the Car Class
    //should still be present
    public new void GetInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Car Condition:{Condition}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Max occupancy: {NumPassengers}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Current Milage: {Distance} miles");
    }
}
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Vehicle obj1 = new Vehicle(5);
        Car obj2 = new Car(5);
        obj1.GetInfo();
        obj2.GetInfo();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Wait, but this again just solves one problem and creates another! We want to just add functionality to a method, not completely over-write everything it does! Well, we are in luck. With a simple additional line to what we have done above we can change the process of method overriding to not just replace all existing functionality, but extend this functionality.</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">public class Vehicle
{
    //All past code for the Car Vehicle
    //should still be present
    public void GetInfo()

        Console.WriteLine($"Current Milage: {Distance} miles");
    }
}
public class Car : Vehicle
{
    //All past code for the Car Class
    //should still be present
    public new void GetInfo()
    {
        //This line will call the parent's version of this method
        //first then add any additional code to it!
        base.GetInfo();
        Console.WriteLine($"Car Condition:{Condition}");
    }

public class Program

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Vehicle obj1 = new Vehicle(5);

<h2>Inheritance and Accessibility</h2>
<p>Earlier in the functions chapter, we talked about the difference between public and private and how public is visible to any code in the same program, but private is only visible by code within the same class. Well, these accessibility levels are more than&nbsp;that, particularly when talking about in regards to class inheritance. See, public methods are inherited as expected; however, private methods are not. If we want to have a method have the visibility of a private method, but still be inherited, we have to use the access modifier of protected in place of public.</p>
<h2>Polymorphism</h2>
<p>When our classes start inheriting from other classes we also have to consider polymorphism. Polymorphism is the idea that objects can be treated as if they belonged to any of the classes above them in the&nbsp;inheritance chain. We can instantiate an instance of a child class and store it in a variable of its parent type.</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">public class Program{
    public static void Main(string[] args) {
    Parent First = new Parent(); 
    Parent Second = new Child(); 
    Parent Third = new GrandChild(); 
    First.Speak();// Will write "I am a parent" 
    Second.Speak(); // Will write "I am a parent"
    Third.Speak(); // Will write class="string from"operator from-rainbow"&gt;-rainbow"&gt;"I am a parent" 
    (Second as Child).Speak(); // Will write "I am a child" 
    (Third as Child).Speak(); // Will write "I am a Child" 
    (Third as GrandChild).Speak();// Will write "I am a grandchild" 
    (First as Child).Speak(); // THIS WILL FAIL!! Cannot cast down the inheritance chain
    }
}
public class Parent { 
    	public void Speak() {
    		Console.WriteLine("I am a parent"); 
    	}
    }
public class Child : Parent{ 
    public new void Speak() { 
        Console.WriteLine("I am a child"); 
    }
}
public class GrandChild : Child{ 
    public new void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("I am a grandchild");
} //}When an object is stored in a variable of a different type it will be treated as if it were that type unless we cast it. In this example, even though our Child and GrandChild classes have their own versions of Speak(), the Parent class implementation is executed. Keep in mind that polymorphism only works when travelling up the inheritance chain, not down.
public class Program{ 
    public static void Main(string[] args) { // THIS WILL NOT WORK!!!!! 
        Child First = new Parent(); 
    }
