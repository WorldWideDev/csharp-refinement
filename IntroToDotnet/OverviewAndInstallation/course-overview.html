<h1>Course Overview</h1>
<p>In this course, you will learn how to create web applications using the C# programming language and the .NET Core environment, specifically ASP.NET Core. There are seven chapters in this course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first chapter is an <strong>introduction</strong> to the primary concepts of the course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second chapter covers the foundations of the <strong>C# language</strong>, primarily through console applications. In addition to the different syntax, you will get accustomed to the slightly different workflow that occurs from C# being a compiled language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the third chapter, we get into the real meat of the course, the <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> MVC framework. This will draw upon the MVC paradigm that you have learned from the previous course(s).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fourth chapter involves using the built-in ORM for .NET, the <strong>Entity Framework</strong> as well as <strong>Dapper</strong> a micro-orm that helps better understand what ORMs are doing. Although we will have connected to the database already, we will use EF to do more sophisticated queries with more elegant source code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fifth chapter covers deloyment, as well as more advanced subjects such as Security and the Identity authentication system, that you can integrate into your ASP.NET Core projects.</p>
<h3>We are glad you are here!</h3>
<p>As with all of the Coding Dojo courses, this one has been designed with a few core techniques in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
 <li>Please make sure to do all the reading for the next day before the morning lecture. This will keep the lectures focused and productive.&nbsp;</li> <li>Throw yourself into the collaborative process with your fellow students. A cohort that learns together, goes farther. As you have 'aha' moments, pass them on! You also have your instructors as resources, of course.&nbsp;</li> <li>Remember the 20-Minute Rule and Strength Through Struggle. In other courses, we intentionally leave gaps (connections that are hinted but not fully detailed) for you to discover and bridge yourself. Try to get to the bottom of your issue before raising it with others.&nbsp;</li> <li>Stay positive! You absolutely can learn all of these new ideas and skills, with the right hard work and focus.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>
