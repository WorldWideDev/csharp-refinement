<h1>Course Overview</h1>
<p>In this course, you will learn how to create web applications using the C# programming language and the .NET Core environment, specifically ASP.NET Core.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ll first discuss the background of the C# language and what makes it different from some of the other languages you've seen so far (like Python or Javascript).</p>
<p>Then we'll start learning the syntax of the <strong>C# language</strong>, primarily through console applications. In addition to the different syntax, you will get accustomed to the slightly different workflow that occurs because C# is a compiled language.</p>
<p>Once we've got the syntax down, we'll get into the real meat of the course, the <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> MVC framework. This will draw upon the same MVC paradigm that you have learned in previous course(s).</p>
<p>Although we will have connected to the database already, we will learn a couple of ORMs to do more sophisticated queries with more elegant source code. We'll first utilize Dapper, a micro-ORM that will help us better understand what ORMs are doing. Then we will learn Microsoft's ORM, the <strong>Entity Framework</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll cover deployment. There will also be some more advanced subjects that you can integrate into your ASP.NET Core projects (eg. Security and Identity authentication).</p>
<h3>We are glad you are here!</h3>
<p>As with all of the Coding Dojo courses, this one has been designed with a few core techniques in mind.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Please make sure to do all the reading for the next day before class. This will keep the discussions focused and productive.</li> <li>Throw yourself into the collaborative process with your fellow students. A cohort that learns together goes farther. As you have 'aha' moments, pass them on! You also have your instructors as resources, of course.</li>
 <li>There are intentional gaps (connections that are hinted but not fully detailed) for you to discover and bridge yourself. Try to get to the bottom of your issue before raising it with others, but also remember the 20-Minute Rule and Strength Through Struggle.</li>
 <li>Stay positive! You absolutely can learn all of these new ideas and skills with the right hard work and focus.</li>
