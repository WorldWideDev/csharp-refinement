<h1>Install</h1>
<p>
    For this course, we need to first get a few things installed before rolling right into the material. Some of these things might not be used until a little later, but it is nice to get them out of the way upfront.
</p>
<h2>Installing Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>
    While it is entirely possible to go through this course using any text editor or a full IDE like full Visual Studio, <strong>we highly recommend installing and working with Visual Studio Code.</strong> It is an excellent tool that provides more than standard text editors, but is more lightweight than a full IDE like Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>
    All you need to do to get the latest version of VS Code is go to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com</a> and click the download button.
</p>
<h2>Installing the 'C# for Visual Studio Code' plugin from OmniSharp</h2>
<p>
    The OmniSharp plugin will give us a ton of extra features when working with C# code in Visual Studio Code, such as ASP.NET syntax highlighting, early (pre-compile) error detection, code suggestions and completion, and insight into different class functionality. It is easy to add: 
    <ol>
        <li>Click on the Extensions icon</li>
        <li>Search for "OmniSharp" or "C#" (the one you want to install will actually be called "C#")</li>
        <li>Click Install</li>
        <li>Once installed, click Reload</li>
    </ol>

</p>
<h2>Installing .NET Core</h2>

<p>Even though .NET Core is relatively young, there have already been several versions released. We are currently using SDK Version: <b>2.0.3</b>, which you can download <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/all">here</a> by first selecting the correct version, and then selecting the installer specific to your operating system.</p>
<p><strong>If you had any terminal windows open during installation (including in VS Code), be sure to restart them before proceeding so that the dotnet commands will be recognized in your terminal.</strong></p>

<h3>
    <strong>MacOS Specific</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Before installing the .NET Core SDK on Mac OS, you need to have the latest version of OpenSSL set up. The easiest way to get OpenSSL is by using Homebrew. If you do not already have Homebrew, you can download and install it by going to
    <a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank">the Homebrew webpage</a>. Once installed, do the following in terminal:
</p>
<pre data-language="bash" class="rainbow">brew install openssl
ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/
ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/
</pre>
<p>
    From there, we can download the .NET Core SDK for Mac by clicking the link above.
</p>
<h2>Installing MySQL Server</h2>
<p>
    <strong>
        Note: if you have taken Python or PHP, you most likely already have MySQL installed and can skip this step.
    </strong>
    Otherwise you may review the installation steps from the Python SQL Chapter.  Test your MySQL server connection by invoking a MySQL shell from your terminal: (the following command assumes you have an administrative user "root")
    </p>
<pre>mysql -u root -p</pre>
<p>After you type in your password, the prompt should change to:</p>
<pre>mysql></pre>
<p>which lets you know you are now logged into your MySQL server. To quit, just type <code>quit</code> or <code>exit</code>.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>NuGet</h2>
<p>
    Microsoft's family of .NET products uses a package manager called <a href="http://www.nuget.org" target="_blank">NuGet</a>. A package manager is simply a tool that helps us bring outside packages into our code. The core NuGet features we need actually came with our SDK installation, so we don't need to do any additional work to use it, but we will be using it indirectly throughout the course to install various packages. (Most package managers are designed for use with a specific language or framework. In Python we used <code>pip</code>, node has <code>npm</code>, Ruby has <code>RubyGems</code>).</p>
