<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>You have finished the introductory chapter. &nbsp;In this chapter, we...</p>
<ol>
<li>Discussed the origin of <strong>compiled languages</strong> and a bit about compilers and linkers,&nbsp;</li><li>Covered a brief history of <strong>language runtimes</strong> and a description of <strong>JIT</strong> in the Java Runtime Environment,&nbsp;</li><li>Mentioned the motivations behind the creation of the <strong>.NET Framework</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>,&nbsp;</li><li>Briefly described the traditional Microsoft developer ecosystem,</li><li>Suggested why Microsoft started to move its developer products toward being more <strong>cross-platform</strong> and even open-source,&nbsp;</li><li>Described the new <strong>.NET Core</strong>, <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong> and <strong>EF Core</strong> from Microsoft, all open-source and cross-platform,&nbsp;</li><li>Installed .NET Core, VS Code, and the C# plug-in from OmniSharp,&nbsp;</li><li>Built our first sample C# app,</li><li>Explored VS Code a bit more.</li></ol>
<p>In the next section, you will start writing more substantial C# code. As you do this, keep in mind the things that we have taught you about compilers, the CLR and VS Code -- these should help you if you start to encounter build-time or execution-time bugs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you encounter problems, think carefully about the error messages that you are given. Over time, these will make more and more sense, and eventually, they will tell you exactly where the bug is and precisely how to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
