<h1>What is C#?</h1>
<p>At the same time as the Universal Runtime (URT) project, which intended to build something akin to the Java Virtual Machine (but better), a smaller group of people started work on a corresponding modern programming language that could showcase all the strengths of the new framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intending to borrow the best pieces of Java, Object Pascal, and C++, and originally code-named&nbsp;<em>Cool</em>&nbsp;(for C-like Object-Oriented Language), this new language <strong><em>C#</em></strong> was released along with .NET Framework 1.0 and Visual Studio .NET in February 2002. It has received regular and substantial updates every 2-3 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>C# is a strongly typed language. Although&nbsp;initially, it worked in <em>static</em> types only, it has since added <em>dynamic</em> typing, coinciding with when the CLR added a Dynamic Language Runtime component to support IronPython. This is a good example of how having a Common Language Runtime can make extending client languages easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The syntax of C# feels similar to C++. It is deeply object-oriented, and its support of structs, enums, delegates, interfaces, and classes will feel familiar to those that have programmed either Java or Swift. Indeed, some say that when inventing and extending Swift, Apple borrowed almost as much from C# as it did from C++ or Objective-C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will dive much deeper into the C# language soon, but first, let's talk about the other pieces of the puzzle.&nbsp;</p>
