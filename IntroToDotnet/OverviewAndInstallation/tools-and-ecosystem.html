<h1>Tools and Ecosystem</h1>
<p style="line-height: 18px;"></p>
<p>From early on in its history, Microsoft has voiced a special passion for "developers, developers, developers." It is no surprise, then, that they surrounded the .NET Framework and C# language with powerful complements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, there is <b style="font-style: italic;">Visual Studio</b> (<b style="font-style: italic;">VS</b>), the <em>integrated development environment </em>(<em>IDE</em>) &nbsp;created specifically for Windows developers. Imagine a code editor with amazing autocomplete knowledge of every library out there, integrated build tools, with a breakpoint debugger, a good performance profiler, built-in source code version control, testing support, helpful templates to start projects of every flavor, and even easy access to samples, documentation, forums, and daily tips. The more expensive, advanced version even does things like auto-generate system architecture drawings from analyzing your source code. Yeah, VS includes a lot!&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, but what if there were some feature you wanted that Visual Studio somehow doesn't have? VS also has extensibility points&nbsp;and a robust marketplace of extensions available. The VS <strong><em>Extension Manager</em></strong> makes it easy to browse and select from the many hundreds available, including great ones such as <em>Web Essentials</em>, <em>ReSharper</em> and <em>JSLint.NET</em>. Creating your own VS Extension isn't all that difficult, either -- there are good templates and examples out there to show you how.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visual Studio isn't the only product in the developer family, either. There are separate products focused on other roles, such as test, architecture, project management, and operations. Plus, the Team Foundation Server (TFS) pulls all these things together and enables additional team-related features via an on-premise server. Not to be left behind as everything else moves to the cloud, <strong><em>Visual Studio Team Services</em></strong> (VSTS) is a scalable cloud-based solution that does everything TFS can and more. Overwhelmed yet?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're not done. Remember, Microsoft builds platforms. Lots of them. Naturally, Microsoft wants developers to build software for all of those platforms. Predictably, there are integration points so that .NET developers can easily connect to Office applications, or server applications such as <em>SQL Server</em> (database), Exchange (messaging), Sharepoint (document management), Systems Center (machine monitoring) and of course <strong><em>IIS</em></strong> (<strong><em>Internet Information Services</em></strong>) -- Microsoft web server that handles HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, and SMTP. Don't forget <em>Azure</em> itself: in addition to VSTS, there are services that gather data and diagnose issues in your web services, DevTest Labs that help you deploy and test your apps, and even a service focused on scaling your APIs. Along with these, there are numerous utilities that connect developers to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All told, there is a dizzying number of tools and services in the Microsoft developer ecosystem. Don't try to understand all of them; for now, don't even try to get familiar with half of them; there will be time for that later. Just know that Microsoft is trying very hard to keep .NET developers productive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, all these rich features, complement products, and ecosystem historically came with one problem: in order to take advantage of it, you needed to use <strong>Microsoft products across the board</strong> -- including Windows on your developer machines and your servers. Despite having a fantastic set of offerings, Microsoft was not getting the traction in the web developer community that it wanted. Once free cross-platform offerings from elsewhere met a minimum quality bar, they were difficult to compete with. With the rise of Satya Nadella as its new CEO, some predicted that a new cross-platform day would dawn for Microsoft.</p>
