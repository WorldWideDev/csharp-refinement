<h1>Working with C#.NET &amp; Console</h1>
<p>While our ultimate goal is to make web applications, we will start learning C# with a more simplified application that we can interact with directly through our console.</p>
<h2>Starting up a new Console App</h2>
<p>To start a new project, we can build out a scaffold of a console application using some of the terminal commands that have been installed for us. This can be accomplished using any terminal client of your choice (VS Code has a built-in terminal emulator, accessed with the shortcut ctrl+`).</p>
<p>In the terminal, navigate to where you'd like all of your C# projects to live. Moving forward, each project should have its own folder. We can make directories manually, or have the CLI build it for us.</p>
<p>Manually:</p>
<pre data-language="bash" class="rainbow">mkdir FirstCSharp
cd FirstCSharp
dotnet new console
</pre>
<p>One line:</p>
<pre data-language="bash" class="rainbow">dotnet new console -o FirstCSharp</pre>
<p>In both of these examples, the name "FirstCSharp" can be replaced by whatever name you would like to give your project. Convention is to name your project using Pascal case (no spaces, all words capitalized).</p>
<p>If we look inside the folder that was just created, we'll see that two files were built for us: 
    <ul>
        <li>Program.cs: the starting point of every project (even throughout the rest of the course, though the contents may change)</li>
        <li>ProjName.csproj: the file that references every dependency for our project. Any time we make add or remove packages, we must run the <code>dotnet restore</code> command, which initiates a script that reads the .csproj file and triggers NuGet to download the appropriate packages. (Upon initial creation of a project, this script is automatically run.)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Now that the files are created, let's get to work! For the most seamless experience, open the entire directory (and <i>only the one </i> project directory) in your text editor. With the OmniSharp extension and Intellisense debugging tool (which we will cover more later on), things will go wrong if you have more than one project open at a time.</p>

<p>To run this application, we just need to run the following terminal command from inside the file structure (i.e. at the same level as your Program.cs file):</p>
<pre data-language="bash" class="rainbow">dotnet run
</pre>
