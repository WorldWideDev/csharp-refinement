<h1>VS Code Features</h1>
<p>Although Visual Studio Code is much slimmer than Visual Studio, it still has some valuable tools to offer us, if we use it correctly. Visual Studio code offers a debugging utility and Git integration right out of the box, and you can add even more functionality with downloadable extensions.</p>
<h3>IntelliSense</h3>
<p>Earlier we had you install the C# OmniSharp extension for VS Code, which adds IntelliSense to the editor&nbsp;and can find references to functions or variables in other files. IntelliSense is basically a grammar checker and a guidebook all in one. When we write code that can never execute, use variables that were never set, call functions that don't exist, or any number of other errors, IntelliSense can detect it and give us feedback. By hovering over one of these error-ed pieces of code, IntelliSense will give us a message about why the code is problematic, and a yellow lightbulb will appear next to the line number. By clicking on the lightbulb we will be given a drop-down of possible solutions. Similarly, IntelliSense will list autocomplete suggestions as we write code, and drop down lists of possible methods we may want to call from objects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one trick with the OmniSharp extension is that <strong>its tools will only work correctly when you open your project's folder into a new window of VS Code!</strong> If you open a container directory and then try to work on files from a subproject within it, IntelliSense and other benefits will not appear.</p>
<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>Debugging is another tool that <strong>requires the folder you're working in to be the top-level folder you have open in VS Code</strong>, just like IntelliSense. If your folder is set up correctly, however, debugging is a snap to get up and running. By default, the debugger only works with Node and Javascript files, but conveniently the OmniSharp extension that we installed previously also includes everything we need to debug C#! When you open your project in VS Code&nbsp;you should see a prompt drop down from the top of the editor offering to create files necessary for debugging; Accept, and you'll see the <code>.vscode</code> folder appear. <strong>Do not copy the .vscode folder from previous projects! It contains references to the specific project it was generated for and will not work with&nbsp;others!</strong> Take a moment to browse through the <code>launch.json</code> file inside and you'll notice it has several different configurations listed. These configurations are generated based on what the debugger can tell about your code, such as whether it runs in the console or on a server. In addition to the attributes present in the default launch.json there are a multitude of other options you can explore using intelliSense if you like. The default configuration is enough to get us up and running, but there's one more feature to learn about before we can use debugging to its full potential. By clicking on the gutter to the left or a line number in your editor you can add a breakpoint. Breakpoints appear as little red circles and they tell the debugger to pause when it hits that line. With the debugger paused, we can see that the panes on the left display all the currently set variables and what values they hold. This is invaluable when searching for errors because we can dynamically check whether a given variable holds what we expect it to. Below the variable pane is the watch panel, where we can add expressions to watch, such as "variableName == 4", and it will evaluate those expressions as the code runs, so we could see whether "variableName" currently equals 4, for example. When you have your&nbsp;breakpoints and watch expressions set up it's time to run the debugger! At the top of the pane you'll see a green arrow, and next to it a drop down menu. select the appropriate mode from the menu and then hit the green arrow, and voila!&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Git Integration</h3>
<p>VS Code's Git tools are extremely user-friendly and easy to use. To get started, simply click the git icon located on the left sidebar of VS Code and click on "Initialize git repository". This will create the repository based on the folder you have open. <strong>Make sure you only have the folder you want your repository associated with open!</strong></p>
>>>>>>> origin/master

<p>Once you've created a repository, you should see any files in the folder listed as uncommitted changes. To start, go ahead and type a commit message in the box near the top of the git pane and then click the check mark above that. Congratulations! you now have all your work saved in your new repo. Any time you make a change it will show up in this pane, and you can commit it at will. If you only want to commit some of your changes, simply click the plus sign that appears when you hover over it. This will stage the change so that the next time you commit, only those changes that have been staged will be committed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can also switch to, or create new branches from the command palette, accessed with ctrl+shift+P on Windows or command+shift+P on Mac. once in the command palette, typing "git" will show us a number of different commands we could run, including listing all branches, switching branches, or creating a new branch on checkout. In addition, the very bottom left corner of the editor will display the name of the branch we are currently working on. Clicking it will give a list of all available branches that can switch to with a click.</p>
<p>VS Code currently does not have a tool for creating a connection to a remote repo, so we still have to use the terminal for that initialization. However, once the connection is in place, we can use the "publish" option from the "..." menu to the right of the commit button. When we publish, a window will pop up asking for our credentials. once we have published for the first time the "push", "pull", and "sync" commands will become available to us.</p>
<p>Like creating a remote connection, VS Code also doesn't give us the ability to run a merge command without using the terminal. However, we&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;see merge conflicts highlighted in our code, making merging a much simpler process!</p>
