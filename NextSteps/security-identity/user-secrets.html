<h1>User Secrets and External Authentication</h1>
<p>
 We know that we can log people in and out securely using Identity manually by defining our own fields and validations. However, many websites now offer an alternative way for their members to log in: third party credentials. We can minimize the effort it takes for users to access our site by allowing them to use a social media account they've already created, such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google. By using these  external login credentials we take advantage of their security for our app. We'll use Facebook for this example, but you can use authentication from any of the supported providers.
</p>
<p>
 In order to use another website's login credentials, we first have to prove our own. Facebook and other authentication providers require that we register our app as a developer. Once we've registered, we need to use the AppId and AppSecret given to us so that the authentication provider we're communicating with knows to trust our app's request.
</p>
<h4>project.json</h4>
<pre data-language="json" class="rainbow">"userSecretsId": "AnyStringYouLike",
//Other code
"tools": {
    //Other tools
    "Microsoft.Extensions.SecretManager.Tools": "1.0.0-preview2-final"
},
"dependencies": {
    //Other dependencies
    "Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.UserSecrets": "1.0.0",
    "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Facebook": "1.0.0"
}
</pre>
<h4>Startup.cs</h4>
<pre data-language="C#" class="rainbow">//Other code
app.UseFacebookAuthentication( new FacebookOptions()
{
    AppId = "Your App Id",
    AppSecret = "Your App Secret"
});
</pre>
<p>
 There's already an issue with this configuration, however. Our AppId and AppSecret are right there in our source code for all to see! We can't push this code to GitHub&nbsp;or let other developers review it with such sensitive information present. Just like our connection string, we need to pull this information out of our code and store it elsewhere. Conveniently, there's a helpful development tool for just such an occasion.
</p>
<h3>UserSecrets</h3>
<p>
 You may have noticed that we already included the SecretManager tool and Usersecrets dependency when we modified our Project.json. The SecretManager tool lets us input values to the command line and then stores them separately from our code. UserSecrets uses the 
 <code>userSecretsId</code> that we set in project.json to The values are put into a json file elsewhere on our computer. Because the values are not encrypted in any way UserSecrets is only appropriate for development environments, not production. UserSecrets uses the <code>userSecretsId</code> that we set in project.json to identify which project the secret we store is associated with.
</p>
<p>
 To store a value using UserSecrets, first make sure you run a dotnet restore to enable the commandline tool. Every secret we store will have a key we can use to access it from within our code. Setting a secret is as easy as typing:
</p>
<pre>dotnet user-secrets set SecretKey SecretValue
</pre>
<p>
In the command line,&nbsp;let's store our AppId and AppSecret for Facebook in UserSecrets now:
</p>
<pre>dotnet user-secrets set Authentication:Facebook:AppId YourFacebookAppId
//Submit and then type
dotnet user-secrets set Authentication:Facebook:AppSecret YourFacebookAppSecret
</pre>
<p>
 Now our Secrets are stored on the computer, but we still have to configure our app to pull them in. We'll do this in Startup.cs:
</p>
<h4>Startup.cs</h4>
<pre data-language="C#" class="rainbow">//Other code
public Startup(IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
            .SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
            .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);
    if( env.IsDevelopment() )
    {
        builder.AddUserSecrets();
    }
     builder.AddEnvironmentVariables();
    Configuration = builder.Build();
}
//Other code
</pre>
<p>
 Here we're only enabling UserSecrets if we're running in a development environment. ASP.NET Core Mvc runs in development by default, so we don't have to do anything special to set it up.
</p>
<p>
 Now that we have access to UserSecrets we can use it to complete our Facebook authentication middleware. We can use any of the values we've stored as UserSecrets in Startup.cs by accessing them as values in our Configuration object:
</p>
<h4>Startup.cs</h4>
<pre data-language="C#" class="rainbow">//Other code
app.UseFacebookAuthentication( new FacebookOptions()
{
    AppId = Configuration["Authentication:Facebook:AppId"],
    AppSecret = Configuration["Authentication:Facebook:AppSecret"]
});
</pre>
<p>
 Our app now has the ability to prove its identity to Facebook. Next up, we need to configure our login process to utilize Facebook authentication. We'll start by modifying our login View.
</p>
<h4>Login.cshtml</h4>
<pre data-language="C#" class="rainbow">//@model
@inject SignInManager&lt;user&gt; SignInManager
//Handle regular login
@{
    var loginProviders = SignInManager.GetExternalAuthenticationSchemes().ToList();
    if( loginProviders.Count &gt; 0 )
    {
        &lt;form asp-controller="YourControllerName" asp-action="ThirdPartyLogin" method="post"&gt;
            @foreach( var provider in loginProviders)
            {
         &lt;button type="submit" name="provider" value="@provider.AuthenticationScheme"&gt;@provider.AuthenticationScheme&lt;/button&gt;
     }
        &lt;/form&gt;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
 This code will check which third party authentication services we've registered and loop through them, displaying a button for each one that can be used to log in. We still need to write the back-end method to actually make a request to our third party authenticator, however.
</p>
<h4>YourController.cs</h4>
<pre data-language="C#" class="rainbow">[HttpPost]
[Route("ThirdPartyLogin")]
public IActionResult ThirdPartylogin(string provider)
{
    //Creates a string representation of the URL route for our 'ThirdPartyLoginCallback' method
    string RedirectUrl = Url.Action("ThirdPartyLoginCallback", "YourControllerName");
     AuthenticationProperties properties = _signInManager.ConfigureExternalAuthenticationProperties(provider, RedirectUrl);
    return Challenge(properties, provider);
}
</pre>
<p>
 This method sends a challenge to Facebook asking for confirmation of the user's identity. The User will be redirected to a Facebook login page where they will be asked for their email and password. Once the user submits their information, the challenge returns to the Action specified by the RedirectUrl, in this case our ThirdPartyLoginCallback Method.
</p>
<h4>YourController.cs</h4>
<pre data-language="C#" class="rainbow">[HttpGet]
[Route("ThirdPartyLoginCallback")]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; ThirdPartyLoginCallback(string remoteError = null)
{
    //If the external login failed, display errors
    if( remoteError != null )
    {
        ModelState.AddModelError(string.Empty, $"Error from external provider: {remoteError}");
        return View("Login");
    }
    //="keyword from-rainbow"&gt;If the external login succeeded, attempt to get the information about the login
    ExternalLoginInfo Info ="keyword operator from-rainbow"&gt;= await _signInManager.GetExternalLoginInfoAsync();
    if( Info == null )
    {
        return RedirectToAction("Login");
    }
    //Attempt to use the login info to sign the user in
    var result = await _signInManager.ExternalLoginSignInAsync(Info.LoginProvider, Info.ProviderKey, isPersistent: false);
    //If the user was found in the system, handle success as appropriate
    if( result.Succeeded )
    {
        await _signInManager.UpdateExternalAuthenticationTokensAsync(Info);
        return RedirectToAction("Show");
    }
    //If the user isn't already in the system, we need to collect more information to create new user
    return View("ThirdPartyConfirmation");
}
</pre>
<p>
 If the user's third party authentication worked we can log them in, but how do we remember the user when we never added them to our system? The simple answer is: we can't. That's why we still have to get some basic information from the new user so that we can add them to our system. After logging in, if they aren't in our system, we render a form for them to submit their additional info. First things first, we'll make a new ViewModel for the form we'll be making,
</p>
<h4>ThirdPartyConfirmationViewModel.cs</h4>
<pre data-language="C#" class="rainbow">using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
 namespace YourNamespace.Models
{
    public class ThirdPartyConfirmationViewModel
    {
        [Required]
        public string UserName { get; set; }
 [Required]
        [EmailAddress]
        public string Email { get; set; }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
 And then we make the View:
</p>
<h4>ThirdPartyConfirmation.cshtml</h4>
<pre data-language="html" class="rainbow">@model YourNamespace.Models.ThirdPartyConfirmationViewModel
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;form asp-controller="YourControllerName" asp-action="ThirdPartyConfirmation" method="POST"&gt;
  &lt;div asp-validation-summary="All"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;label asp-for="UserName"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input asp-for="UserName"&gt;
  &lt;label asp-for="Email"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input asp-for="Email"&gt;
  &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>
 We'll then use the information our user submits, along with the login info from our third party authenticator to create a new user, associate that login info with that user, and then save them to our database. Because we associated the login info with the user, our system will recognize those credentials as valid for signing in that particular user, enabling them to log in with just the click of a button in future.
</p>

        ExternalLoginInfo Info = await _signInManager.GetExternalLoginInfoAsync();
        if( Info == null )
        {
            return RedirectToAction("Login");
        }
        //Create the new user
        var User = new User{ UserName = model.UserName, Email = model.Email};

            if( Result.Succeeded )
