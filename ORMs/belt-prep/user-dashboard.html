<p>This is one of the best assignments you can do to prepare for the qualifying exam as well as to improve your coding skills. Many of our students have made this a part of their portfolio and have expressed how this assignment really helped them to understand the fundamentals of web programming. We encourage all of you to finish this assignment if you have time. Also, make sure you use Git to back up your code along the way.</p>
<p><em>GitHub is a social network hub for programmers. You can look at what other programmers are working on, check their code and make suggestions or changes. You may share projects you are working on and collaborate with other programmers for updates or additional features.</em></p>
<p><em>Upload your work for this exercise on GitHub and ask some of your cohort mates or other programmers to peruse your code and suggest changes/updates. Do the same thing for your cohort mates' work</em></p>
