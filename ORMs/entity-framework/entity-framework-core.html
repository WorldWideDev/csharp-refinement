<h1>Entity Framework Core</h1>
<p>EF Core is the newest incarnation of the Entity Framework, which was first created in 2008. Entity Framework Core was designed to be more powerful and flexible than Entity Framework&nbsp;and will support a wider variety of databases. As with all of the&nbsp;<code>core</code>&nbsp;technologies that Microsoft has created, EF Core is more modular than its previous versions. This means we can pull in just the pieces we need and avoid extra code-bloat.</p>
