<h1>Dapper ORM</h1>
<p>Dapper is a Micro-ORM that was built by StackExchange (The parent company of StackOverflow) for one main purpose: To&nbsp;allow for mapping database responses to models while not sacrificing any speed provided by raw&nbsp;SQL.</p>
<p>Due to the amount of data and number of relations each rendered page of StackOverflow has, the engineers there knew that they couldn't be spending a lot of&nbsp;time "Over the wire" making multiple requests and waiting for&nbsp;responses to and from ASP.NET and a Database server. They instead needed a system where they could just build one rockstar SQL query string that would get all they needed accomplished in one hit complete with a response string that contained all the information they might need.&nbsp;As such, they did not want to take the typical approach of many ORMs&nbsp;that sacrifice this possibility&nbsp;in exchange for ease of use for the developer when dealing with simple requests. Instead they kept the need for the developer to write the needed SQL for a request so that it could be possible to send a single query string to the Database while expecting only a single response string back.</p>
<p>By doing this, Dapper keeps the time that we do not have control of to a minimum, thereby providing&nbsp;the aforementioned speed. What Dapper does on the request side of things is that it eases the call to the Database for the user by obscuring some of the boilerplate that goes along with making this request. Dapper also would not be an ORM if it did not give us the ability to <strong>map</strong> models to our data in some way. Once we get a response string back from the Database, Dapper can make the different keys and values for the model objects you provided to the various string fields of the response.</p>
<p>This process is extremely similar to the model mapping we have seen in the past&nbsp;when we are sending information to a controller method from a form where&nbsp;we can&nbsp;provide a model for ASP.NET Core to map the various form input fields to. From there, anything else that happens in regards to the newly created data models is completely in the programmer's hands as Dapper is only helping with these pieces!</p>
