<p>Dapper was built by Sam Saffron and is actively used on StackExchange sites. It was built with speed optimization in mind to handle the thousands of queries for pages and particularly in response to Google web crawling.(&nbsp;<a href="https://samsaffron.com/archive/2011/03/30/How+I+learned+to+stop+worrying+and+write+my+own+ORM" target="_blank">If you'd like you can read more here!</a>). It also provides features like Object Binding and direct access to the IDBConnection class too.</p>
<p>Earlier we presented the idea of models which are a critical component to working with Dapper. If we look at the User model we created, we can use Dapper to set up actual MySQL database queries and methods for a table that reflects this model.</p>
<p><strong>User Model</strong></p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
namespace YourNamespace.Models
{
    public abstract class BaseEntity {}
    public class User : BaseEntity
    {
        [Key]
        public long Id { get; set; }
 
        [Required]
        [MinLength(3)]
        public string Name { get; set; }
 
        [Required]
        [EmailAddress]
        public string Email { get; set; }
 
        [Required]
        public string Password { get; set; }
    }
}
</pre>
<blockquote>Note we added a BaseEntity Class that User inherits from to allow models we build from here on out to be easier to work with in a generic way. If we build a method that can work with just about any type of model, we can allow that method to accept type BaseEntity objects rather than having to define additional methods for each model class</blockquote>
<p>Once we have this in place we need to add 1&nbsp;new dependency&nbsp;to our project and continue to include the MySql Connector package used before as well!</p>
<ul><li><code>dotnet add package Dapper</code></li></ul>
<p>Dapper is more or less a micro ORM. We get the ability to obscure much of the database querying process and make a direct connection between our models and database fields, but we must still write methods for the SQL queries we would like to run. We will, therefore, be creating a UserFactory class that is going to contain our MySQL connection request as well as each of these SQL methods that dapper will be using. Start by adding two files to a new folder called&nbsp;<strong>Factories</strong>&nbsp;in a project.</p>
<p><strong>IFactory.cs</strong></p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">using DapperApp.Models;
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace DapperApp.Factory
{
    public interface IFactory&lt;T&gt; where T : BaseEntity
    {
    }
}
</pre>
<p><strong>UserFactory.cs</strong></p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using Dapper;
using System.Data;
using MySql.Data.MySqlClient;
using DapperApp.Models;
 
namespace DapperApp.Factory
{
    public class UserFactory : IFactory&lt;User&gt;
    {
        private string connectionString;
        public UserFactory()
        {
            connectionString = "server=localhost;userid=root;password=root;port=8889;database=mydb;SslMode=None";
        }
        internal IDbConnection Connection
        {
            get {
                return new MySqlConnection(connectionString);
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>This will define the connections to the MySQL Database using a connection string similar to the one we used before. The next part is to begin writing the SQL query methods. These methods should be built out in the UserFactory class, but if they are methods that you feel should exist for all model interactions (such as Create, Read, Update, Destroy), they should also be included in the IFactory class for the same reasons as before when thinking of Models as a generic BaseEntity class.</p>
<p><strong>Query methods added to UserFactory.cs</strong></p>
<h4>UserFactory.cs</h4>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">//USERFACTORY CLASS DEFINITION
 
        public void Add(User item)
        {
            using (IDbConnection dbConnection = Connection) {
                string query =  "INSERT INTO users (user_name, email, password, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (@Name, @Email, @Password, NOW(), NOW())";
                dbConnection.Open();
                dbConnection.Execute(query, item);
            }
        }
        public IEnumerable&lt;User&gt; FindAll()
        {
            using (IDbConnection dbConnection = Connection)
            {
                dbConnection.Open();
                return dbConnection.Query&lt;User&gt;("SELECT * FROM users");
            }
        }
        public User FindByID(int id)
        {
            using (IDbConnection dbConnection = Connection)
            {
                dbConnection.Open();
                return dbConnection.Query&lt;User&gt;("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = @Id", new { Id = id }).FirstOrDefault();
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>These methods have some good examples of the dapper functionality in them. We always need to include a statement to open a line of connection to the database and then call another method to run a query. Dapper provides both these methods for us. Also with the Query method, we can specify a model type to bind with&nbsp;the statement. We can then inject the model's attributes into our query using the<strong>&nbsp;@</strong>&nbsp;symbol in front of an attribute variable. Note that Dapper also provides a .Execute function that we can use instead for when we do not need a return value from our query. With that in mind, that's all there is in using Dapper! We can now just call our SQL query methods from a controller after instantiating a UserFactory object.</p>
<p><strong>HomeController.cs</strong></p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using DapperApp.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using DapperApp.Factory; //Need to include reference to new Factory Namespace
namespace DapperApp.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly UserFactory userFactory;
        public HomeController()
        {
            //Instantiate a UserFactory object that is immutable (READONLY)
            //This establishes the initial DB connection for us.
            userFactory = new UserFactory();
        }
        // GET: /Home/
        [HttpGet]
        [Route("")]
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            //We can call upon the methods of the userFactory directly now.
            ViewBag.Users = userFactory.FindAll();
            return View();
        }
    }
}
</pre>
