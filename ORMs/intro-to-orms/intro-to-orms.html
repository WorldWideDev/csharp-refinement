<h1>Object Relational Mapper</h1>
<p>The database systems we use are designed independently of any particular framework or language. Because of this, we need a go-between to communicate with them. In general, we achieve that with an ORM&nbsp;or Object Relational Mapper. These tools allow us to map our database tables to object classes we create. In addition, many databases only support having simple alpha-numeric value stored in them and ORMs will handle serializing more complex data for us and un-serializing it upon retrieval.</p>
