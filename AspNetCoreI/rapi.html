<h1>Calling Card</h1>
<p>Its about time we put some of this new knowledge to use. We have learned about creating a ASP.NET Core app, using MVC, and simple aspects of returning JSON. Before we move into views we will practice routing, route parameters and JSON responses with a quick assignment.</p>
<p>Create a simple app that reads in parameters from a single GET route and renders the values with a JSON response. Your route should accept four parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>First Name</li>
<li>Last Name
</li><li>Age</li>
<li>Favorite Color</li>
</ul>
<p>A user using your app would expect to enter a route such as <code>http://localhost/Tim/Toolmam/42/Brown</code> to which you should display the appropriate information as a JSON response.</p>
