<h1>Error Feedback</h1>
<p>As we start developing more and more complex web apps, we will also start to encounter more errors and exceptions. Trying to resolve these issues without being provided any meaningful explanation would certainly be frustrating. The debugger can become even more useful as we try to follow the request-response cycle of a web app.</p>
<p>We also have another tool available to us, particularly for when we don't know where exactly our app is failing. To receive more explicit error messages about the state of our app, we just need to make sure our work environment is set to <strong>Development mode</strong>. Notice in the Configure method of our Startup file the following condition:
    <pre>
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    </pre>
</p>
<p>The default environment is Production mode, which is the version of our project we want our end users to see. We wouldn't want our users to see in plain text our erroneous lines of code (i.e. a Developer Exception Page), but we certainly want to see them!</p>
</p>
<p>To put our current work environment into Development mode, we need to change an environment variable for .NET.</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p><strong>Command Line</strong></p>
<pre data-language="bash" class="rainbow">
    setx ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT Development
</pre>
<p><strong>PowerShell</strong></p>
<pre data-language="bash" class="rainbow">
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT","Development","User")
</pre>
<h4>macOS/Linux</h4>
<pre data-language="bash" class="rainbow">
    export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
</pre>
<p>After changing any environment variables, you should always restart any terminals you have open (including VS Code). Now on our local machine, we'll always see the Developer Exception Pages. When we are ready to deploy our application, we'll want to make sure the hosting server is set to Production mode.</p>

<h1>Dotnet Watch</h1>
<p>One more helpful tool is the <code>Dotnet Watcher</code>. Running our application with this tool tells our project to automatically rebuild and run after we make changes to our <code>.cs</code> files. Though not crucial, this tool can save us some time during our learning experience. To begin using Dotnet Watcher, we need to alter our csproj file to include the following lines of xml:</p>
<pre data-language="xml" class="rainbow">&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.DotNet.Watcher.Tools" Version="2.0.2" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</pre>
<p>Remember, any time you make changes to your csproj file, you should always run <code>dotnet restore</code>. After restoring, you can run your application with the Watcher tool with the following command (instead of <code>dotnet run</code>):</p>
<pre data-language="bash" class="rainbow">dotnet watch run
</pre>
<p>Note: Even though the Watcher is running, it may still take a few seconds for your project to rebuild after a change.</p>
