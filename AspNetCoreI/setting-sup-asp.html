<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>Setting up a web application with the ASP.NET Core framework is almost as simple as it was to build a console application. After navigating to where you'd like your project to be saved, we will use the <code>web</code> argument (instead of <code>console</code>) with our <code>dotnet new</code> command:</p>
<pre data-language="bash" class="rainbow active_pre">dotnet new web -o ProjectName
</pre>
<p><strong>Note, it is important to give each project a unique name. If not it may cause problems with dependencies!</strong> The project name you choose should be the <strong>namespace</strong> used for all the files you create in a given project.</p>
<p>Open the newly created folder and examine its contents. You'll notice the same csproj file and Program.cs, with some slight changes to their actual content. The csproj file now includes the dependencies for the ASP.NET Framework; the Main function in Program.cs now calls a method to spin up a web server (Kestrel by default) to host our code.</p>
<p>You'll also notice a new file: Startup.cs. Our Main method calls on this Startup class to determine how this application will be configured. For a web application, this means specifying how the application will handle the http request-response cycle. We'll be configuring our application in this file shortly!</p>
<p>As is, running <code>dotnet run</code> will deliver a "Hello World!" message at localhost:5000.</p>
