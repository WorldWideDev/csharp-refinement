<h1>Returning JSON</h1>
<p>
We know that our controller methods can return strings, but generally we'll want them to return something a little more useful. The simplest, most useful option is JSON. JSON is used for performing AJAX operations with our front end, and it is the most common return format for APIs. ASP.NET Core Mvc controllers contain a method for serializing C# objects into JSON so creating an API backend is a snap.
</p>
<h3>YourController.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
 
namespace YourNamespace.controllers
{
    public class YourController : controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        [Route("")]
        public JsonResult Example()     //notice the return type is now JsonResult
        {
            // The Json method convert the object passed to it into JSON
            return Json(SomeC#Object);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>Json()</code> method will accept any type of object for serialization, from simple values like ints to complex objects:
</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="active_pre rainbow">// Other code
[HttpGet]
[Route("displayint")]
public JsonResult DisplayInt()
{
    return Json(34);
}
 
// Suppose we're working with the Human class we wrote in the previous chapter
[HttpGet]
[Route("displayhuman")]
public JsonResult DisplayHuman()
{
    return Json(new Human());
}
</pre>
<h3>Anonymous Objects</h3>
<p>
If we want to return a group of values as JSON we have to write a class definition with appropriate fields to contain the data. But what if a different route is needed to return a slightly different number of values, or values of different types? We'd need to write an additional class for each configuration of values. Instead, we can use what are known as <strong>anonymous objects</strong>. Anonymous objects can be instantiated as a grouping of property names and values, without conforming to any class.
</p>
<p>
Here we construct an anonymous object with FirstName, LastName, and Age properties:
</p>
<pre data-language="csharp" class="rainbow">// Other code
[HttpGet]
[Route("displayint")]
public JsonResult DisplayInt()
{
    var AnonObject = new {
                         FirstName = "Raz",
                         LastName = "Aquato",
                         Age = 10
                     };
    return Json(AnonObject);
}
</pre>
<p>
Anonymous objects aren't just used to format information for JSON responses; they can be used anywhere you need them. However, they are best used in moderation -- defining classes provides much better code readability in most situations. If you ever find yourself constructing multiple anonymous objects with the same set of properties, you definitely need a class!
