<h3>BaseEntity</h3>
<p>
A common convention when working with ASP.NET Core Models is to define a BaseEntity class that all of our Model classes inherit from. BaseEntity serves as a generic reference that we can use to distinguish our Models from all other classes. We can also add fields or&nbsp;methods to BaseEntity as long as they are used by all of our defined Models.</p>
<p>
BaseEntity is commonly implemented simply as an empty abstract class.
