<h1>Routing</h1>
<p>What if our url follows a certain pattern, but also contains potentially varying pieces of information? We can also accept parameters in our routes with the {} notation included in our route string argument:</p>
<h3>YourController.cs</h3>
<pre data-language="csharp" class=" code-toolbar language-csharp"><code class="  language-csharp">// Other code
[HttpGet]
[Route("template/{name}")]
public JsonResult Method(string name)
{
    // Method body
}

[HttpGet]
[Route("template/{id}/{action}")]
public JsonResult Method(int id, string action)
{
    // Method body
}
</code><div class="toolbar"></div></pre>
<p>Whatever variable name you choose in the curly braces of your route string should match the variable name you use as input to the associated method. Be aware that if your method expects to receive a parameter through the URL, it will break if it doesn't receive one.</p>
