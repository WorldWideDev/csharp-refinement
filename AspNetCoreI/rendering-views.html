<h1>RApi, The Rapper Api</h1>
<p>Now that we are able to serve back JSON responses to web requests, we can do something interesting. In the previous section we worked with some records for artists and groups when practicing our LINQ knowledge. We are going to use those same collections again, but now we will provide endpoints for various requests for information from these data sets. What we are essentially doing is building our own external API from these collections. For this assignment we will be actively reinforcing our knowledge on LINQ, ASP.NET Core Method routing, and serving back JSON responses. Once again we will also provide a starter project from which to build from which can be downloaded by clicking the button below</p>
