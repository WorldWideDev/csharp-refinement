*numbering reflects current platform order; the actual order presented here is my recommendation

1. Intro to ASP.NET Core (video only) -- okay; consider a redo at some point
2. Setting up ASP.NET Core
3. Developer Tooling
4. MVC!
5. Controllers
7. Returning JSON <-- MOVED UP   ******need updated html
    //assignment: start building a basic API; get all method
6. Attribute Routing
    //assignment: add to previous API to get a specific entry
8. A: Calling Card <-- I think this is a weird assignment...
9. A: RApi (optional)
10. Rendering Views     *****need updated html
    //intro of "IActionResult"
13. Static Files    <-- MOVED UP
14. A: Portfolio    <-- MOVED UP
11. Razor View Engine
12. A: Time Display
15. Forms & ViewBag <-- SPLIT UP; Forms only
16. A: Dojo Survey
    //simplify the assignment to have the form submission return a JSON version of the data submitted (i.e. no ViewBag); note that it is okay to render on a redirect for now
Models <-- ADDED/REVISED FROM ASP CORE II
    //essentially ViewModels; this will show forms with models instead of just separate values
Model Validations <-- ADDED/TO REVISE FROM ASP CORE II
18. Redirecting
    //assignment: add validations to Dojo Survey; redirect if success, render with errors if not valid
19. Session & TempData
20. A: Random Passcode
21. A: Dojodachi
22. Wrap-up

17. AJAX Refresher <-- MOVE ELSEWHERE (& develop more)

base-entity <-- snippet to add to some other content later, when we have more models and can use it for db models and not view models or something to explain it better
