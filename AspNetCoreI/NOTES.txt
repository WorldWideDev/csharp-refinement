*numbering reflects current platform order; the actual order presented here is my recommendation

1. Intro to ASP.NET Core (video only) -- okay; consider a redo at some point
2. Setting up ASP.NET Core
3. Developer Tooling
4. MVC!
5. Controllers
7. Returning JSON <-- MOVED UP   ******need updated html
    //assignment: start building a basic API; get all method
6. Attribute Routing
    //assignment: add to previous API to get a specific entry
8. A: Calling Card <-- I think this is a weird assignment...
9. A: RApi (optional)
10. Rendering Views              ******need updated html
    //intro of "IActionResult"
13. Static Files    <-- MOVED UP
14. A: Portfolio    <-- MOVED UP
11. Razor View Engine
12. A: Time Display
Model Directive <-- NEW! (maybe there's a better name? My first title was "passing data from controller to view" but that felt kind of long; I like throwing little bits of terminology in there, but keeping everything else pretty simple.)
A: About Me <-- NEW ASSIGNMENT! (uploaded simple wireframe - about-me.png)
View Models <-- NEW! (first intro)
A: <-- FIGURE OUT A NEW ASSIGNMENT (still something relatively simple)
15. Forms & ViewBag <-- SPLIT UP; Forms only
16. A: Dojo Survey I
Models <-- ADDED/REVISED FROM ASP CORE II
    //essentially ViewModels; this will show forms with models instead of just separate values
    A: Dojo Survey II <-- NEW ASSIGNMENT    *MODEL BINDING WITH A DROPDOWN CAN BE TRICKY...
Model Validations <-- ADDED/TO REVISE FROM ASP CORE II
Rendering Errors <-- NEW! BROKE OUT FROM MODEL VALIDATIONS MODULE
    //add a video to show ModelState with debugger
18. Redirecting (maybe break out redirecting with attributes)
    //assignment: add validations to Dojo Survey; redirect if success, render with errors if not valid
19. Session & TempData
20. A: Random Passcode
21. A: Dojodachi
22. Wrap-up

17. AJAX Refresher <-- MOVE ELSEWHERE (& develop more)

base-entity <-- snippet to add to some other content later, when we have more models and can use it for db models and not view models or something to explain it better
